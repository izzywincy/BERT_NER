{"id":96,"text":"EN BANC\n[ A.M. No. CA-24-002-P (Formerly JIB FPI No. 22-016-CA-P), October 10, 2023 ]\nCOURT OF APPEALS, COMPLAINANT, VS. ROMMEL P. LABITORIA, CLERK II, JUDICIAL RECORDS DIVISION, COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\nSINGH, J.:\n\nThis case stemmed from a Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) Report,[1] dated June 8, 2023, pertaining to the Letter,[2] dated October 20, 2022 of Court of Appeals (CA) Presiding Justice Remedios A. Salazar-Fernando, referring the October 14, 2022 Report and Recommendation (Report),[3] that recommended Rommel P. Labitoria (Labitoria), Clerk II, Judicial Records Division, CA Manila, to be charged with Grave Misconduct for using illegal drugs and\/or substances.\nThe Facts\n\nOn July 7, 2022, the CA conducted a random drug test facilitated by the Kaiser Medical Center at the CA Auditorium. The drug test was conducted through Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer.[4]\n\nLabitoria's drug test report[5] revealed the presence of methamphetamine (or shabu), which was confirmed by the Labtox Analytical Laboratory, Inc.:\n\nDrug\/Metabolite\nResult\nRemarks\nMETHAMPHETAMINE\nPOSITIVE\nCONFIRMED\nTETRAHYDROCANNABINOL\nNEGATIVE\nPASSED\nOn August 4, 2022, a Notice of Result of Random Drug Test[6] was sent to Labitoria to challenge the same within fifteen (15) days from notice. Labitoria, however, did not respond.[7]\n\nOn September 5, 2022, Labitoria, with two other employees, were referred to the Manila Health Department for a drug dependency examination and for further intervention, following Item No. VI of Civil Service Memorandum Circular No. 13, s.2017.[8]\n\nOn October 5, 2022, a Memorandum[9] was issued directing Labitoria to show cause why no disciplinary action should be taken against him for Grave Misconduct for having been found positive for the use of dangerous drugs in violation of Section 50 (A) (3), Rule 10 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in Civil Service. However, Labitoria, despite receipt, did not submit a response.[10]\n\nIn his Report and Recommendation,[11] dated October 14, 2022, Atty. Arnel Macapagal recommended that Labitoria be formally charged with Grave Misconduct, albeit his first offense, for being found positive for the use of dangerous drugs, and for the case to be indorsed to the JIB. The Report stated that the confirmatory Drug Test Report became final when he failed to prepare a challenge test and his silence on the show cause memorandum constituted more than prima facie evidence for the charge.[12]\n\nThe JIB, in a 1st Indorsement dated December 5, 2022, directed Labitoria to comment on the charges against him.[13]\n\nLabitoria, in his Comment,[14] dated December 12, 2022, admitted using illegal drugs sometime in May 2022 when he attended a birthday celebration in Nueva Vizcaya. He averred that he was convinced to try the illegal substance to keep him alert on the drive back to Manila. He expressed deep remorse and promised not to engage in said act again. He likewise stated that he had been undergoing the required rehabilitation and has yielded two (2) consecutive negative results since. He appealed to the Court stating that he has been in government service since 1994, as a Clerk II at the First Level Court, an Emergency Laborer at the Commission on Elections since 2007, and Clerk II at the Judicial Records Division of the Court of Appeals since 2012, and prayed that these be considered as mitigating circumstances together with his candid admission of fault and sincere promise to improve his ways.[15]\n\nThe Report and Recommendation of the JIB\n\nIn his Report and Recommendation,[16] JIB Acting Executive Director Atty. James D.V. Navarette recommended, among others, that Labitoria be found guilty of Grave Misconduct and be dismissed from the service. The JIB adopted and approved the factual findings of the Acting Executive Director with modification, as follows:\n\nThe instant administrative case be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter against respondent Rommel P. Labitoria, Clerk II, Judicial Records Division, Court of Appeals, Manila; and\n\nRespondent Rommel P. Labitoria be found guilty of Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances and be dismissed from the service with prejudice to re-employment in any government agency, including government-owned or controlled corporations, and with forfeiture of retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits.[17]\nThe Issue\n\nShould Labitoria be administratively charged for possession and\/or use of illegal drugs or substances?\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nThe Court adopts and approves the recommendation of the JIB with modification.\n\nMisconduct is the transgression of some established or definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, unlawful behavior, willful in character, improper or wrong behavior.[18] The misconduct, however, becomes a grave offense if it involves any of the additional elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rules, which must be established by substantial evidence.[19]\n\nIn In Re: Administrative Charge of Misconduct Relative to the Alleged Use of Prohibited Drug of Reynard B. Castor,[20] the Court ruled that a flagrant violation of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, satisfies the requisites of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, and\/or wanton disregard of established rules in order to categorize such misconduct as grave in nature and warrant the erring employee's dismissal from the service.[21]\n\nRule 140, Section 14 (o) of the Rules of Court (Rule 140),[22] as amended, provides possession and\/or use of illegal drugs or substances as a serious charge. Serious charges are sanctioned under Section 17 of Rule 140:\n\nSection 17. Sanctions. –\n\n(1)\nIf the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:\n\n\n\n\n(a)\nDismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits.\n\n(b)\nSuspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six (6) months but not exceeding one (1) year; or\n\n(c)\nA fine of more than P100,000.00 but not exceeding P200,000.00.[23]\nLabitoria, who stubbornly ignored previous directives to respond to the notice to challenge and show cause order from the CA, eventually admitted to using illegal drugs in May 2022. That he was \"convinced\" to take these to stay awake as he drove back home does not absolve him from administrative liability.\n\nJurisprudence stresses that the image of a court of justice is mirrored in the conduct, official, and otherwise, of the personnel who work thereat. Court personnel have been enjoined to adhere to the exacting standards of morality and decency in their professional and private conduct in order to preserve the good name and integrity of the courts of justice.[24] In In Re: Special Report on the Arrest of Rogelio M. Salazar, Jr., Sheriff IV, Regional Trial Court – Office of the Clerk of Court, Boac, Marinduque, for violation of Republic Act No. 9165,[25] the Court reminded that \"all members and employees of the Judiciary are expected to adhere strictly to the laws of the land, one of which is [R.A. No. 9165] which prohibits the use of dangerous drugs. . . .\"[26]\n\n[T]he conduct of a person serving the judiciary must, at all times, be characterized by propriety and decorum and above all else, be above suspicion so as to earn and keep the respect of the public for the judiciary. The Court would never countenance any conduct, act or omission on the part of all those in the administration of justice, which will violate the norm of public accountability and diminish or even just tend to diminish the faith of the people in the judiciary.\"[27]\n\nThe Court has, in previous cases, dismissed court employees for testing positive for taking prohibited drugs, and whose benefits were forfeited.[28]\n\nIn the 2021 case of Re: Alleged Smoking and Possible Drug Use of Louie Mark U. De Guzman (De Guzman),[29] the Court dismissed the respondent from the service after he tested positive for the use of marijuana by a drug test administered by the National Bureau of Investigation, and by his own admission, the Court reiterated the sanctions meted to every government official or employee found positive for the use of dangerous drugs under the Civil Service Commission rules:\n\nAlso, it is provided under Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 13, Series of 2010, that any official or employee found positive for use of dangerous drugs shall be subjected to disciplinary\/administrative proceedings with a penalty of dismissal from the service at first offense pursuant to Section 46 (b) (19), Chapter 7, Book V of Executive Order No. 292 and Section 22 (c), Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 and Other Pertinent Civil Service Laws.[30]\n\nThe Court nevertheless directed De Guzman to be referred to a suitable drug rehabilitation facility where he may be able to undertake programs for his rehabilitation at his own expense.\n\nHere, without a doubt, Labitoria's use of prohibited drugs violated the norms of conduct for public service, committing conduct unbecoming of court personnel, and tarnishing the very image and integrity of the Judiciary.[31] As correctly found by the JIB, Labitoria is guilty of Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances, sanctioned as a serious charge under Rule 140, Section 14.\n\nHowever, the Court finds it proper to modify the imposable penalty recommended by the JIB.\n\nThe Court notes that Labitoria underwent and completed the mandatory drug rehabilitation, alleging that he has yielded two (2) consecutive negative results since, and has spent thirty-one (31) years in government service. The Court likewise takes note that Labitoria has another administrative case for Habitual Tardiness[32] pending before the Court.\n\nOn April 18, 2023, the Court En Banc approved A.M. No. 23-02-11-SC or the Guidelines for the Implementation of a Drug-Free Policy in the Philippine Judiciary (Guidelines), that took effect on September 17, 2023. These Guidelines reaffirm R.A. No. 9165, Section 2, which mandates that it is the State's policy to provide effective mechanisms or measures to reintegrate into society individuals who have fallen victim to drug abuse or dependence through sustainable treatment and rehabilitation programs.\n\nSection 6 of the Guidelines provides the following administrative liabilities for court employees:\n\nSECTION 6. Administrative Liability.\nA. Court Employees\n\ni.\nA positive confirmatory result or challenge test result for drug use, except as provided under Section 7, shall constitute as basis for an administrative charge of Possession and\/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substance, which is considered a serious charge under Section 14(o) of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. 21-08-09-SC (Rule 140).\n \t \nii.\nThe following acts shall also constitute Gross Misconduct under Section 14 (a) of Rule 140:\n \t \t \n\n1.\nTampering with any result of a drug test;\n \t \t \n\n2.\nInterfering in the conduct of the drug test or in the release of drug test results; and\n \t \t \n\n3.\nRefusing to undergo or complete their treatment or rehabilitation as provided under Section 8 hereof, once found positive for use of dangerous drugs.\n \t \niii.\nThe failure of a court employee, without a valid reason, to undergo mandatory drug testing after being randomly selected under Section 5(D) shall constitute Gross Insubordination under Section 14(n) of Rule 140.\n \t \niv.\nThe procedure under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court shall govern the institution of administrative proceedings under these Guidelines.\n. . .\n\nSECTION 7. Voluntary Submission. —\n\nThe DFWC of the SC, CA, SB, CTA, or OCA, as the case may be, shall provide a mechanism for court employees to willingly submit themselves, of their own volition, for the treatment and rehabilitation of existing drug-taking habits. Voluntary submission for drug testing may be done any time prior to the date of the random drug testing as may be fixed by the DFWC. This notwithstanding, the procedure for the conduct of drug testing under the voluntary submission mechanism shall follow Section 5 (D) and (E) in this Guidelines.[33]\n\nThe Court expresses grave concern for the biopsychosocial effects of drug abuse and acknowledges that drug abuse is a public health challenge best addressed by employing effective practices in implementing a drug-free policy in the Judiciary. Rather than being seen as a mere criminal issue, drug abuse should be as it is now internationally viewed as a complex health disorder that is preventable and treatable. Thus, the Court must strike a balance between imposing administrative sanctions for the Serious Charge of Using Prohibited Drugs and Substances without diminishing the high standards imposed on all members of the Judiciary, across all ranks.\n\nConsidering that this is Labitoria's first offense, his thirty-one (31) years in government service, and his completed drug rehabilitation program, testing negative for the use of drugs two consecutive times, the Court finds these mitigating circumstances[34] applicable to impose the lower penalty of suspension for one (1) year, in lieu of the recommended dismissal from the service, pursuant to Section 20 Rule 140.[35]\n\nACCORDINGLY, the present administrative case is RE-DOCKETED as a regular administrative matter against respondent Rommel P. Labitoria, Clerk II, Judicial Records Division, Court of Appeals, Manila.\n\nThe Court finds the respondent Rommel P. Labitoria GUILTY of Possession and\/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances, a serious charge under Section 14(o) of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. 21-08-09-SC and orders his SUSPENSION from office without salary and other benefits for one (1) year. He is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of a similar violation will be dealt with the penalty of dismissal from service. This Resolution is immediately executory.\n\nThe Supreme Court Medical and Dental Services is directed to refer Rommel P. Labitoria to a suitable drug rehabilitation facility where he may be able to undertake programs for his continued rehabilitation during the period of his suspension, at his own expense.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nGesmundo, C.J., Leonen, SAJ., Caguioa, Hernando, Inting, Zalameda, M.

{"id":97,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ A.C. No. 13550 [Formerly CBD Case No. 16-5170], October 04, 2023 ]\nARIEL CONDUCTO CASTILLO, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. RESTITUTO S. MENDOZA, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nKHO, JR., J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Complaint[1] for disbarment of respondent Atty. Restituto S. Mendoza (respondent) filed by complainant Ariel Conducto Castillo (complainant) on November 23, 2016 for respondent's alleged misrepresentation and deceit in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).[2]\n\nThe Facts\n\nComplainant alleged that he met respondent sometime in August 2015 in connection with the extrajudicial settlement of the estate of his deceased mother, Lagrimas Conducto Castillo (Lagrimas). Respondent represented complainant's sister, Annelyn[3] Castillo-Wico (Annelyn).[4] According to complainant, respondent asked him and his other siblings to sign an Extra­ Judicial Settlement of Estate of Deceased Lagrimas Conducto Castillo with Waiver of Claims Against Planters Bank SPC Branch[5] (EJS with Waiver) dated October 2, 2015 in relation to their agreement that part of Lagrimas' money deposited in Planters Bank will be withdrawn and used to pay for the estate tax. Believing that respondent was acting in good faith, complainant signed the EJS with Waiver with the assistance of his lawyer. To complainant's surprise, Annelyn asserted one day that she owns all the money that was deposited in their mother's account, the entirety of which was already withdrawn prior to Lagrimas' death. This prompted complainant to verify the status of the account in Planters Bank. When he was told that the withdrawal was still being processed, complainant sent Planters Bank a letter[6] repudiating the EJS with Waiver and directing the bank to stop the transaction until the parties have resolved their dispute.[7]\n\nOn January 14, 2016, respondent filed with the court a Petition[8] to approve the last will and testament pertaining to Lagrimas' Huling Habilin,[9] which was notarized on September 26, 2008. Claiming that said Huling Habilin was revoked by the Last Will and Testament[10] executed by Lagrimas on January 13, 2014 wherein he was designated as the administrator of his mother's estate, complainant filed an Opposition[11] to said Petition.[12]\n\nSometime in May 2016, complainant was allegedly informed by respondent that half of the money that was deposited in the Planters Bank account was already withdrawn and that certain amounts have been distributed to complainant's siblings and some were pocketed by respondent instead of using the same for the payment of estate tax, as earlier agreed upon. This was allegedly done by respondent in connivance with an employee of Planters Bank. Moreover, respondent sent a collection letter to the buyer of a property located in Paule 1, Rizal, Laguna (Paule Property) without complainant's knowledge despite the fact that the latter was already the owner of said property by virtue of a Deed of Absolute Sale[13] dated January 16, 2014, which was signed by Lagrimas in his favor; thus, respondent was neither authorized to send the collection letter nor collect any payment for the said property.[14]\n\nIn sum, complainant advanced that respondent deceived him into signing the EJS with Waiver and thereafter, withdrew the money of complainant's deceased mother in connivance with a Planters Bank employee despite complainant's repudiation of said document, and that respondent sent a demand letter and collected payment for the Paule Property without any authority from complainant.[15]\n\nFor his part, respondent alleged that as Annelyn's and thereafter, her brother Arman Castillo's (Arman) lawyer in the settlement of Lagrimas' estate, he invited complainant and his two other siblings to a meeting to discuss the possibility of amicably partitioning the estate of their mother. Complainant, assisted by his lawyer, along with his other siblings, agreed to withdraw the one-half share of their mother's account in Planters Bank for the payment of taxes. Respondent denied deceiving complainant into signing the EJS with Waiver and explained that he was initially advised by Planters Bank to draft said document to secure the release of the funds. However, the bank subsequently informed him that they would require a final order for the settlement of Lagrimas' estate, which prompted respondent to file the petition. Respondent also refuted complainant's averment that Annelyn withdrew the entire amount deposited in the Planters Bank account. According to respondent, Annelyn merely took out her one-half share in the account, of which she was the co-depositor, while the other half remained intact. Respondent likewise denied distributing certain amounts from said account to complainant's siblings and pocketing some of the funds. It was allegedly Annelyn herself who withdrew half of her share therein without any participation from respondent. Moreover, respondent retorted that Lagrimas sold the Paule Property by virtue of a Contract to Sell[16] dated November 7, 2013, contrary to complainant's assertion that it was sold to him. by virtue of a Deed of Absolute Sale dated January 16, 2014. Respondent insisted that he was duty bound to collect all receivables, including moneys and properties, belonging to Lagrimas' estate in his supposed capacity as lawyer of the same. Respondent then presented the demand letter[17] dated April 26, 2016 addressed to the purported buyer of Paule Property, wherein respondent clearly indicated Lagrimas' estate as his client. Aside from complainant's propensity to sue, respondent avers that the complaint was only filed to harass him and get back at him for blocking complainant from getting more than what complainant should inherit.[18]\n\nThe IBP Report and Recommendation\n\nIn a Report and Recommendation[19] dated September 10, 2021, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Investigating Commissioner (IC) recommended that respondent be found administratively liable for violating, Canon 1, Rule 1.01, Canon 7, Rule 7.03, and Canon 10, Rule 10.03 of the CPR and hence, be meted with the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of five years.[20]\n\nIn so recommending, the IC found that complainant was not able to present substantial evidence to establish respondent's culpability in allegedly deceiving complainant into signing the EJS with Waiver and thereafter, withdrawing money from Lagrimas' Planters Bank account, which respondent distributed in part to complainant's siblings and kept the other part for himself. However, respondent committed acts of deceit and gross misconduct when he: (1) made misrepresentations in the demand letter that he sent to the purported buyer of the Paule Property, in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 7, Rule 7.03 of the CPR; and (2) interfered with and assumed the jurisdiction of the probate court in attempting to collect the payment from the purported buyer without any authority, in violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 10, Rule 10.03 of the CPR.[21]\n\nIn light of the foregoing—and further considering that in Adelfa Properties, Inc. (Now Fine Properties, Inc.) v. Mendoza,[22] where respondent was previously meted with the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of six months, with a stern warning that a commission of the same or similar offense would merit a more severe penalty[23]—the IC recommended that respondent be meted with the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of five years.[24]\n\nOn September 13, 2021, a Manifestation and Motion to Dismiss[25] was filed by respondent, citing therein the Order[26] dated June 11, 2019 of the probate court which ordered the petition withdrawn. Alleging that the same was in view of the amicable settlement and reconciliation among the parties and that the disbarment case was merely \"a collateral case or an adjunct of a bitter probate proceedings between the siblings,\"[27] respondent moved for the dismissal of the instant complaint.\n\nIn a Resolution[28] dated April 23, 2022, the IBP Board of Governors (BOG) resolved to modify the Report and Recommendation of the IC by reducing the recommended penalty to be imposed on respondent to suspension from the practice of law for one year, as it found the original recommended penalty by the IC, i.e., suspension for five years, to be excessive.[29]\n\nOn August 31, 2022, a Comment\/Motion for Reconsideration[30] was filed by respondent with this Court on the IBP-BOG 's Resolution dated April 23, 2022.\n\nThe Issue Before the Court\n\nThe issue for the Court's resolution is whether respondent should be held administratively liable for the acts complained of.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nAfter a judicious perusal of the records of this case, the Court resolves to reverse and set aside the IBP-BOG's resolution finding respondent guilty of deceit and gross misconduct for his misrepresentation in the demand letter and interference with the jurisdiction of the probate court.\n\nHowever, the Court agrees with the findings of the IC and the IBP-BOG that complainant failed to show by substantial evidence that respondent deceived complainant into signing the EJS with Waiver. The Court likewise concurs with the finding that complainant failed to present substantial evidence to show respondent's' involvement in withdrawing money from Lagrimas' account in Planters Bank, which respondent supposedly distributed to complainant's siblings and a portion of the money to himself.\n\nFurther, the Court holds that respondent's act of sending the demand letter to the purported buyer of the Paule Property was merely prompted by his desire to protect the interest of Annelyn and Arman therein, as his clients, which will eventually redound to the benefit of Lagrimas' estate.\n\nSince the settlement and partition of Lagrimas' estate has not yet concluded, Lagrimas' heirs own the same in common.[31] As co-owners, each of them holds the properties in the estate, including the Paule Property, pro indiviso and exercises their individual rights over the entirety of the same.[32]\n\nA co-heir or co-owner may pursue action or suit without involving the other co-owners if said action is for the benefit of all.[33]Accordingly, Annelyn and Arman, as co-owners, may demand from the buyer of Paule Property the latter's arrears for the property's purchase as it will be for the benefit of the estate and ultimately, the heirs.\n\nThe Court finds that the demand letter by itself does not show respondent's intention to deceive or misrepresent his authority nor completely disregard the established procedures for the settlement of estate. Respondent, representing Annelyn, was in fact the one who filed the petition for the probate of Lagrimas' will and an urgent motion for the appointment of special administrator. As respondent claimed, said letter was for the purpose of preventing the dissipation of moneys and properties belonging to Lagrimas' estate pending the appointment of an administrator by the probate court. Moreover, complainant has not shown any ill intention by respondent to keep for himself or for his clients any collection that may be obtained from the buyer. Respondent was simply being zealous in protecting his clients' cause. Lastly, the Court notes respondent's Manifestation and Motion to Dismiss attaching the Order dated June 11, 2019 of the probate court, which deemed the petition withdrawn due to the amicable settlement of the parties. Said manifestation and motion was not opposed by complainant, thereby showing that he has dismissed his contempt against respondent spurred by the bitter probate proceedings between complainant and his siblings.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the instant Complaint against respondent Atty. Restituto S. Mendoza is DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nLazaro-Javier, M. Lopez and J. Lopez. JJ., concur.\nLeonen,* SAJ. (Chairperson), on leave but left his

{"id":99,"text":"FIRST DIVISION\n[ OCA-IPI No. 18-4887-RTJ, October 28, 2024 ]\nMARIA MAGDALENA R. JOVEN, COMPLAINANT, VS. HON. MONIQUE A. QUISUMBING-IGNACIO, PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 209, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANDALUYONG CITY, VICTOR M. PE BENITO, SHERIFF IV, AND ALFREDO MARCELO BERMEJO, ADMINISTRATIVE AIDE IV, ALL OF BRANCH 209, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANDALUYONG CITY, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nROSARIO, J.:\n\nBefore this Court is a Letter-Complaint[1] and Supplemental Complaint[2] (collectively, Complaint) filed by Maria Magdalena R. Joven (Joven) charging respondents Hon. Monique Quisumbing-Ignacio (Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio), Presiding Judge, Victor Pe Benito (Sheriff Pe Benito), Sheriff IV, and Alfredo Marcelo Bermejo (Bermejo), Administrative Aide IV, all of Branch 209, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Mandaluyong City, with gross ignorance of the law, gross misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, relative to Civil Case No. R-MND-18-00315-CV, titled \"Anna Marie Sison, represented by Attorney-in-Fact Rosario de Silva Perion v. Magdalena R. Joven (and all persons claiming rights under her),\" a case for recovery of property with prayer for the issuance of preliminary mandatory injunction (the Civil Case).\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe facts of the case are lifted from the Report[3] of the Judicial Integrity Board (JIB), as follows:\nAnna Marie Sison (Sison), represented by her attorney-in-fact, Rosario de Silva Perion (Perion), filed the complaint in the Civil Case to recover possession of a parcel of land situated in Mandaluyong City, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 008-201000489. [Joven] was the defendant in the Civil Case.\n\nDuring the hearing in the Civil Case on March 20, 2018, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio tackled [two] incidents raised by the parties, i.e., Sison's motion for the issuance of Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction (Writ of Injunction); and [Joven]'s Omnibus Motion to Dismiss, which was incorporated in her verified Answer with Affirmative and Special Defenses with Counterclaim.\n\nDuring the hearing on the motion for the issuance of the Writ of Injunction, [Joven]'s counsel objected to portions of Perion's testimony, as narrated in her Judicial Affidavit for being leading and without basis. Thus, in her March 20, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio directed Perion: to file her \"Comment on the Motion to Strike Out Certain Portions of the Judicial Affidavit of [Perion] (Motion to Strike Out),\" which was made in open court; to file her Formal Offer of Evidence (FOE) relative to the motion for the issuance of a Writ of Injunction; and to file her Opposition to [Joven]'s Motion to Dismiss within [five] days therefrom, or until March 26, 2018. [Joven], on the other hand, was directed to file her Comment on the FOE, and to file her Reply to the Opposition, to be filed by Perion, within the same number of days from receipt thereof.\n\nHowever, Perion filed her Opposition and her Comment to [Joven]'s Motion to Strike Out only on March 27, 2018. Thus, in her Reply, [Joven] also included therein a Motion to Expunge Comment\/Opposition (Motion to Expunge).\n\nIn its May 9, 2018 Notice of Pre-Trial Conference, RTC Branch 209 scheduled the Pre-Trial Conference (Pre-Trial) on May 15, 2018, directing the parties in the Civil Case to submit their respective pre-trial briefs at least [three] days before the scheduled hearing, among others.\n \nDuring the Pre-Trial on May 15, 2018, only Perion's counsel appeared. Moreover, it was only then that she submitted the required pre­-trial brief, without furnishing [Joven] or her counsel with a copy thereof. [Joven], on the other hand, submitted her pre-trial brief earlier on time and was present in court. Accordingly, [Joven]'s counsel moved for the outright dismissal of the case. However, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio did not immediately rule on the motion and instead declared that the Civil Case should be first referred to mediation and Judicial Dispute Resolution.\n\nIn her May 15, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio cancelled the pre-trial and declared as submitted, the following motions of [Joven] for resolution: Omnibus Motion to Dismiss; Motion to Strike Out; and the open court Motion to Dismiss on the ground of plaintiffs (as represented by Perion) absence during the pre-trial and failure to submit a copy of the pre­trial brief on time.\n\n[Joven] alleged that on May 30, 2018, she received [three] separate Orders from the RTC: the May 21, 2018 Order, denying all of Joven's motion to strike out certain portions of Perion's Judicial Affidavit; another May 21, 2018 Order, granting Perion's FOE; and the May 22, 2018 Order, denying [Joven]'s Omnibus Motion to Dismiss. [Joven] observed that in the issuance of the said Orders, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio justified the shortcomings and corrected the errors in the pleadings filed by Perion.\n\nIn her June 4, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio denied [Joven]'s open court Motion to Dismiss the Civil Case, stating therein that Perion substantially complied with the requirements of the Rules of Court and that, since an earlier case involving the same subject matter was dismissed due to technicalities, the present Civil Case should now be decided on the merits. Thereafter, the Pre-Trial in the Civil Case was reset to July 24, 2018.\n\nIn a separate June 4, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio granted Perion's motion for the issuance of a Writ of Injunction, conditioned on her posting and court's approval of a bond in the amount of [PHP] 100,000.00.\n\nOn June 6, 2018, [Joven] was furnished with a copy of Perion's pleading [titled] \"Compliance (with Very Urgent Request for Approval and Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction)\" (Compliance with Request for WPI). Attached thereto as \"Annex A\" is a copy of the June 4, 2018 Order. [Joven] alleged that she was confused as to the nature of the said pleading as she had not yet received any court issuance relative to Perion's prayer for a Writ of Injunction.\n\nIn her June 7, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio issued the Writ of Preliminary Injunction.\n\nOn June 19, 2018, [Joven] filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Motion for Voluntary Inhibition. [Joven] claimed that she received copies of the [two] June 4, 2018 Orders only on June 13, 2018 through mail, while Perion received the same on June 5, 2018. [Joven] insisted that the belated receipt of the Orders effectively prevented her from pursuing the judicial remedies available to her.\n \n[Joven] found it highly unusual that the Writ of Injunction was issued the day after Perion's filing of her Compliance with Request for WPI, essentially denying her the chance to oppose it. In addition, [Joven] also observed that all of her motions relative thereto were denied, while Perion's lone pleading, was immediately granted. [Joven] asserted that Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio's bias and partiality were further manifested when orders were sent to her through registered mail while those sent to Perion were served personally, despite the fact the offices of the counsels for both parties are in Mandaluyong City.\n\nSince the Writ of Injunction was already issued, [Joven] filed a Motion to Recall Writ of Preliminary Injunction with Motion for Voluntary Inhibition (Motion to Recall), setting the hearing thereof on July 10, 2018. On that day, however, the scheduled hearing was reset to July 24, 2018 due to the delay in the delivery of the pertinent pleadings through regular mail.\n\nOn July 24, 2018, during the supposed hearing on [Joven]'s Motion to Recall, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio ordered the parties to proceed with the pre-trial instead. [Joven]'s counsel at the time was appearing only by way of special appearance, for the sole purpose of her Motion to Recall. Nonetheless, the said counsel was ordered to read the pre-trial briefs already submitted so they could proceed with the pre-trial conference. Thereafter, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio issued the Pre-Trial Order and set the trial dates for the plaintiffs presentation of evidence without referring the Civil Case for mediation or Judicial Dispute Resolution.\n\nIn her August 10, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio directed [Joven] to show cause why she should not be cited in contempt of court for disobeying the directives stated in the Writ of Injunction, which the latter received on August 13, 2018. From the records, it appears that the Writ of Injunction was served upon [Joven] on June 18, 2018.\n\nIn her August 17, 2018 Manifestation and Compliance, by way of response to the August 10, 2018 Order, [Joven] explained that due to the pendency of several incidents, the implementation of the Writ of Injunction should be suspended. Further, she stated that Sheriff Pe Benito did not go to her house for its implementation. In addition, [Joven] informed the court that her counsel of record just withdrew his appearance and she would need time to get a new one. Moreover, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio has yet to refer the case to mediation or Judicial Dispute Resolution.\n\n[Joven] opined that Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio was bent on having her evicted from the subject property, hence, her inaction on the pending incidents.\n\nThereafter, [Joven] filed a Motion To Set the Hearing for Judicial Dispute Resolution and Motion for Inhibition. [Joven] argued in the motion for inhibition that [Bermejo], who was detailed to RTC Branch 209 by the City of Mandaluyong, is related to Perion's counsel, Atty. Roberto C. Bermejo (Atty. Bermejo), thus, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio cannot be expected to handle the Civil Case fairly. The hearing on both motions was set on a September 7, 2018, but was rescheduled on September 11, 2018.\n \nIn her September 11, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio referred the Civil Case to mediation. Upon the conclusion of the mediation hearing on September 18, 2018, [Joven] was immediately arrested by the police as soon as she exited the court room pursuant to a Warrant of Arrest issued by Judge Quisumbing-lgnacio on September 6, 2018 for [i]ndirect [c]ontempt of [c]ourt for her refusal to comply with the Writ of Injunction.\n\nIn her September 13, 2018 Order, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio denied [Joven]'s motion for bail and ruled that the latter shall remain imprisoned until the directives of the Writ of Injunction are obeyed.\n\nFinally, [Joven] concluded that the collective acts of the respondents in the case at bar caused her undue injury, and are in violation of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nIn her Comment, respondent Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio prayed for the immediate dismissal of the [C]omplaint for lack of merit, stressing at the outset, that in her October 8, 2018 Order, she had already inhibited from the Civil Case, as prayed for by [Joven] in the latter's several motions for inhibition.\n\nJudge Quisumbing-Ignacio denied that she was merely getting back at [Joven], for the latter's filing of the instant administrative case when she issued the herein assailed Orders. She pointed out that she received the October 18, 2018 1st Indorsement from the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), directing her to file her Comment on the letter of complaint, sometime in November 2018, while all of the Orders relative to the Civil Case, as assailed by [Joven] were issued prior to that date.\n\nAs to how the court issuances or processes were sent to the parties, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio explained that Perion regularly made follow ups on the status of the Civil Case. Thus, whenever a court order or notice is issued, Atty. Bermejo or his representative would come to court to personally receive it. Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio further denied that Atty. Bermejo was personally close to the staff members of the RTC. She explained that her staff members, being government employees, were merely courteous to Atty. Bermejo but treated him like any other counsel for a litigant. In contrast, [Joven] and\/or her counsel appeared to have been contented with receiving orders and notices through the mail.\n\nWith respect to the purported delay in the conduct of hearing, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio asserted that she studies every folder of cases heard in her sala. But the sheer volume of her caseload and the fact that the hearings for civil cases in her court are limited to [one] day per week, the delay in the disposition of the numerous motions filed by both parties in the Civil Case is unavoidable.\n\nAs regards [Joven]'s Motion for Bail, Judge Quisumbing-lgnacio explained that the same was filed at around 4:30 [p.m.]. The motion was properly documented only on the following day when she immediately resolved it, although the same was denied for legal grounds stated therein.\n\nFinally, Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio asserted that [Joven] had no intention to heed the orders of the court. [Joven] particularly refused to obey the directives of the Writ of Injunction, insisting that it was void due to several pending motions that must be resolved first before the same should have been issued. What [Joven] failed to mention is that she flooded the court with numerous motions to prevent her eviction from the subject property by virtue of the said writ.\n\nIn his Comment, respondent Sheriff Pe Benito denied that he failed to serve the writ of injunction upon [Joven], and even denied that he had a role in its delayed service upon her. Sheriff Pe Benito emphasized that his role in the Civil Case was limited to serve the writ of injunction and the September 6, 2018 Order upon the parties in the Civil Case. All other court processes and issuances are mailed by the process server or personally claimed at the RTC's receiving area by the parties or their representatives.\n\nIn her March 8, 2019 Manifestation and Motion, Judge Quisumbing-­Ignacio stated that [Joven] and Perion, in her capacity as attorney-in-fact of the plaintiff in the Civil Case, had already entered into a Compromise Agreement that was approved by RTC Branch 208, where the Civil Case was assigned after her inhibition, in its December 7, 2018 Order, and that complainant had already vacated the subject property.[4] (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)\nReport of the JIB\n\nIn its Report,[5] the JIB recommended that the administrative complaint against Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio, Sheriff Pe Benito, and Bermejo, be dismissed for lack of merit, and for being judicial in nature.[6]\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nWe adopt the recommendation of the JIB.\n\nTime and again, this Court has ruled that the filing of an administrative complaint is not the proper remedy for every action of a judge considered \"aberrant or irregular\" especially when a judicial remedy exists.[7]\n\nA perusal of the records of the case clearly shows that complainant Joven resorted to the filing of this administrative case merely to get back at Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio for the latter's alleged bias and partiality emanating from her denial of Joven's motions. However, what Joven failed to understand is that the assailed issuances of Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio were issued in the exercise of her judicial discretion, which is beyond the realm of administrative proceedings.\n\nIn Biado v. Hon. Brawner-Cualing,[8] this Court held that:\n\"[A]n administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for every act of a Judge deemed aberrant or irregular where a judicial remedy exists and is available.\" It must be underscored that \"the acts of a judge in [their] judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action.\" [They] cannot be civilly, criminally, or administratively liable for [their] official acts, \"no matter how erroneous,\" provided [they act] in good faith.[9] (Citations omitted)\nIn Bello III v. Judge Diaz,[10] We ruled that \"disciplinary proceedings against judges do not complement, supplement or substitute judicial remedies, whether ordinary or extraordinary. An inquiry into their administrative liability arising from judicial acts may be made only after other available remedies have been settled.\"[11]\n\nLikewise, in Ala v. Judge Peras,[12] We ruled that:\nUntil and unless there is an authoritative pronouncement that the questioned orders of the respondent Judges were indeed tainted by anomaly, there would be no ground to prosecute the respondent Judges, either administratively or criminally, for rendering them. Thus, an administrative complaint is not the appropriate remedy for every act of a judge deemed aberrant or irregular where a judicial remedy exists and is available, for if subsequent developments prove the judge's challenged act to be correct, there would be no occasion to proceed against [them] at all. Thus, the charges being judicial in nature, the remedy of the complainant should have been with the proper court\/or the appropriate judicial action and not with the OCA by means of an administrative complaint.[13] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)\nFrom the foregoing, the alleged errors raised by Joven pertain to Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio's exercise of judicial discretion. Hence, these cannot be the proper subject of an administrative complaint but must be addressed through appropriate judicial remedies.\n\nIn fact, as correctly noted by the JIB, Joven filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 before the Court of Appeals (CA) on September 17, 2018, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 157587, assailing the issuances of Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio. The CA dismissed the petition for being filed out of time.[14] Clearly, Joven was aware of the available judicial remedies for her case. This bolsters the fact that her resort to the present administrative complaint is improper.\n\nMoreover, We emphasize that complainant Joven miserably failed to substantiate her claims that Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio acted in bad faith, and with bias and partiality through substantial evidence or such amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other equally reasonable minds might conceivably opine otherwise.[15] The standard of substantial evidence is satisfied when there is reasonable ground to believe that respondent is responsible for the misconduct complained of, even if such evidence might not be overwhelming or even preponderant.[16]\n\nBad faith and malice cannot be presumed just because the judgment or order rendered by a Judge is adverse to the complainant.[17]\n\nIn Sampiano v. Judge Indar,[18] this Court defined bad faith in this wise:\nBad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of a sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill-will; it partakes of the nature of fraud. It contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or some motive of self-interest or ill-will for ulterior purposes. Evident bad faith connotes a manifest deliberate intent on the part of the accused to do wrong or cause damage.[19] (Citation omitted)\nBefore a judge can be held liable for deliberately rendering an unjust judgment or order, one must be able to show that such judgment or order is unjust and that it was issued with malicious intent to cause injustice to the aggrieved party.[20] In administrative proceedings, the burden of proof rests on the complainant, who must be able to support and prove by substantial evidence his or her accusations against respondent. This Joven failed to do. Apart from her bare allegations, Joven failed to produce any evidence that would show that the assailed orders and issuances were issued without basis, and with manifest partiality. Adequate proof, not mere conjectures or speculations, should be offered. Otherwise, the same deserves no consideration at all.\n\nAnent Joven's allegations against Sheriff Pe Benito and Bermejo, she likewise failed to prove the same through substantial evidence. Sheriff Pe Benito's participation in the Civil Case was limited to his ministerial duty of serving the writ of injunction, and the September 6, 2018 Order upon Joven. With regard to Bermejo, Joven failed to show how his relation to Atty. Bermejo was a factor in the issuance of Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio's assailed issuances.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the Complaint for gross ignorance of the law, gross misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct against Hon.

{"id":98,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 267487, August 30, 2023 ]\nJOSE P. SINGH, PETITIONER, VS. PERFECTO S. CORPUS, JR. AND MARLENE S. CORPUS, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nLAZARO-JAVIER, J.:\n\nThis Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assails the Decision[2] dated November 24, 2022 and the Resolution[3] dated May 30, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 115943, which affirmed with modification the finding of malicious prosecution against petitioner Jose P. Singh (Singh) and ordering him to pay respondent Atty. Perfecto S. Corpus, Jr. (Atty. Corpus) PHP 300,000.00 as moral damages, PHP 200,000.00 as exemplary damages, PHP 100,000.00 as attorney's fees, and PHP 17,360.00 as cost of suit.[4]\n\nAntecedents\n\nThis case stemmed from a complaint for damages filed by respondents Spouses Atty. Corpus and Marlene Corpus against petitioner.[5] The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 2017-284 and raffled to the Regional Trial Court, Branch 258, Parañaque City.[6]\n\nAtty. Corpus essentially averred that sometime in May 2014, he and Singh met at Café Breton, Makati. Singh confided to him that he was inclined to discharge the services of his counsel in Civil Case No. 07-09-3871* is also entitled \"Platon v. Aguinaldo IV, et al.\" where Singh was one of the defendants.[7] The case involved a 5,309-square meter lot located in Tanauan City, Batangas.[8] Singh also told him that he was then represented by Atty. Gino Jacinto (Atty. Jacinto) from Quicho and Angeles Law Offices but the latter allegedly raised their attorney's fees without Singh's concurrence.[9]\n\nOn June 9, 2014, Singh informed him that he tried to communicate with QALO which nonetheless was unresponsive.[10] Singh thus engaged his services as counsel in Civil Case No. 07-09-3871 filed before the Regional Trial Court, Tanauan, Batangas.[11] Atty. Corpus discussed with Singh the applicable laws and their legal strategy. In their retainer agreement, Singh agreed to pay PHP 30,000.00 as acceptance fee. On June 11, 2014, Singh deposited the PHP 30,000.00 acceptance fee to Atty. Corpus's personal account.[12]\n\nThereafter, on June 14, 2014, he agreed to accompany Singh to Canyon Woods Properties in Taal, Batangas. There, they again discussed Civil Case No. 07-09-3871. Atty. Corpus inquired about the case records, but petitioner told him that the same were still in the custody of Quicho and Angeles Law Offices.[13] Later, Singh offered him one of his houses in Canyon Woods but Atty. Corpus declined.[14]\n\nBy Letter dated June 18, 2014, Singh asked him to examine the sufficiency of a draft Secretary's Certificate and Special Power of Attorney relative to Civil Case No. 07-09-3871, which he did.[15]\n\nOn June 20, 2014, Singh instructed Atty. Corpus to hold in abeyance all work in Civil Case No. 07-09-3871.[16] Singh asked Atty. Corpus to handle another case instead against the owners and residents of Canyon Woods.[17] Atty. Corpus declined the offer though due to its complexity.[18]\n\nIn a Letter elated June 30, 2014, Singh told Atty. Corpus that he was terminating their retainer's agreement, sans any explanation.[19] Singh, too, demanded the return of the PHP 30,000.00 acceptance fee.[20] In his reply letter, Atty. Corpus agreed to terminate the retainer agreement but not the return of the PHP 30,000.00 acceptance fee.[21] He explained that he already commenced the legal work by conducting extensive study on the facts, related laws, and jurisprudence relative to Civil Case No. 07-09-3871. He also maintained that he already attended several meetings about the case.[22]\n\nThereafter, Singh sent another Letter dated July 4, 2014, calling him \"immoral\" for refusing to return the PHP 30,000.00 \"entrusted money\" despite not having rendered any service yet.[23] He threatened that if the amount would still be unreturned by July 10, 2014, he would file a disbarment case against him.[24]\n\nIn his Letter dated July 7, 2014, Atty. Corpus responded that the PHP 30,000.00 was not \"entrusted money\" but payment for his acceptance of Civil Case No. 07-09-3871 which he already started working on.[25] He also learned that when Singh decided to terminate the services of his previous counsel in Quicho and Angeles Law Offices, he, too, instructed the counsel to return the PHP 30,000.00 acceptance fee.[26] Singh, thus, had the habit of terminating the services of his counsel and demanding the return of the acceptance fee paid.[27] He furnished copy of this letter to Quicho and Angeles Law Offices and Singh's wife, Adelia Singh (Adelia).[28]\n\nAtty. Corpus later discovered that Singh made good his threat to file a disbarment Complaint against him docketed as A.C. No. 10529. There, Singh imputed negligence to Atty. Corpus for his alleged failure to render any legal service to Singh in Civil Case No. 07-09-3871, and unethical conduct for (a) furnishing copies of his Letter-Reply to Quicho and Angeles Law Offices and his wife; and (b) refusal to return the PHP 30,000.00 acceptance fee despite the termination of their retainer agreement.[29]\n\nBy Resolution[30] dated March 5, 2018, the Court dismissed the disbarment Complaint for lack of merit. The Court held that Singh failed to adduce sufficient evidence concerning Atty. Corpus's alleged infraction of the Lawyer's Oath and the then Code of Professional Responsibility.[31] The Court also emphasized that records did not show he was impelled by any ulterior motive when he furnished copies of his Letter-Reply to Singh's wife, and Quicho and Angeles Law Offices who was still considered as lead counsel in Civil Case No. CV-07-12-3871.[32] As regards the acceptance fee, the Court adopted the report of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Commission on Bar Discipline that acceptance fee refers to the charge imposed by the lawyer for merely accepting the case. Hence, by accepting Civil Case No. 07-12-3871, he incurred an opportunity cost since he was precluded from handling cases of the opposing party based on the prohibition against the conflict-of-­interest rule.[33] Thus, he did not commit any infraction when he failed to return the acceptance fee to Singh. The Court concluded \"[t]he duty of the Court towards members of the bar is not only limited to the administration of discipline to those found culpable of misconduct but also to the protection of the reputation of those frivolously or maliciously charged.\"[34]\n\nSingh, thus, fabricated a story of negligence[35] for the sole purpose of coercing him to return the acceptance fee.[36] The baseless disbarment case he filed against him tarnished his reputation as a private practitioner for 35 years and even as a former judge of Municipal Trial Court in Cities in San Fernando, Pampanga.[37] Due to the baseless and malicious administrative case filed against him, his law practice had been negatively affected, as attested by his peers Atty. Cecil Fojas and Atty. Leonardo Aguilar.[38] His application for appointment as notary public was even delayed.[39] He, thus, prayed that petitioner be liable for damages.[40]\n\nDuring the pre-trial conference on March 11, 2019, Singh and his counsel failed to appear despite notice. The trial court, thus, allowed Atty. Corpus to present evidence ex parte.[41]\n\nThe Ruling of the Regional Trial Court\n\nBy Decision[42] dated October 16, 2020, the trial court found Spouses Singh jointly and severally liable to pay Atty. Corpus PHP 300,000.00 as moral damages, PHP 200,000.00 as exemplary damages, PHP 100,000.00 as attorney's fees, and PHP 17,360.00 as cost of suit.[43]\n\nIt held that based on the Resolution[44] dated March 5, 2018 of the Court, the disbarment complaint filed by Singh against Atty. Corpus was baseless, frivolous, and unfounded[45] amounting to malicious prosecution which entitled Atty. Corpus to damages.[46] While the law does not impose penalty on the right to litigate, the same should be exercised with caution.[47]\n\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nOn appeal, Singh argued that none of Atty. Corpus's family members or clients testified to prove that his reputation was damaged due to the disbarment Complaint filed against him.[48] Meanwhile, the act of malicious prosecution alleged in Atty. Corpus's Complaint was imputed to Singh alone. Therefore, his wife, Adela, should not be held liable in the case.[49]\n\nBy Decision[50] dated November 24, 2022, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification. It held that Singh indeed filed a baseless and malicious disbarment complaint against Atty. Corpus. The Complaint was meant to vex Atty. Corpus since the latter did not return the PHP 30,000.00 acceptance fee. Acceptance fee, though, is generally non-refundable as it is not measured by the extent of the legal services rendered but seeks to compensate the lawyer for lost opportunity. Besides, Atty. Corpus already did some legal work for the case as shown in their communications and meetings.[51] On account of malicious prosecution, the trial court correctly held Singh liable for moral damages under Article 2219 (8)[52] of the Civil Code, exemplary damages as vindication of Atty. Corpus's suffering and wanton invasion of his rights, as well as attorney's fees, and cost of litigation.[53]\n\nSingh's Motion for Reconsideration was denied under Resolution[54] dated May 30, 2023.\n\nThe Present Petition\n\nPetitioner now seeks affirmative relief before the Court via Rule 45. He reiterates that it was immoral for Atty. Corpus not to return the PHP 30,000.00 entrusted money though the latter never performed any legal work.[55] Too, none of his family members or clients testified to prove that his reputation had been damaged.[56] At any rate, the act of filing the disbarment Complaint against Atty. Corpus should not be deemed a malicious prosecution because the law would not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to litigate.[57]\n\nRuling\n\nThe issues raised here by Singh are a mere rehash of the same questions pertaining to the unfounded malicious and baseless accusations in the disbarment complaint he filed against Atty. Corpus, as well as the issue of whether to return the PHP 30,000.00 acceptance fee previously given to Atty. Corpus. These issues are purely factual in nature and the Court will not take cognizance of them since it is not a trier of facts. Besides, in the absence of any showing that the courts below committed grave abuse of discretion or otherwise misappreciated the evidence, their concurrent factual findings are binding and conclusive upon the Court.\n\nIn any event, petitioner has failed to adduce any special reason to warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction.\n\nAmounts Awarded\n\nWe reduce, however, the award of damages pursuant to jurisprudence. In granting the damages for malicious prosecution, the Court in Spouses Co v. Development Bank of the Philippines[58] reduced the award of moral damages from PHP 100,000.00 to PHP 20,000.00, exemplary damages from PHP 100,000.00 to PHP 20,000.00, and attorney's fees from PHP 100,000.00 to PHP 10,000.00. Likewise, in Sosmeña v. Bonafe, et al.,[59] the Court found Sosmeña liable for malicious prosecution and reduced the damages awarded to Bonafe, et al. to PHP P30,000.00 as moral damages, PHP 20,000.00 as exemplary damages, and PHP 10,000.00 as attorney's fees. The Court likewise imposed a 6% interest per annum on these monetary awards.\n\nThus, we reduce the damages granted to Atty. Corpus to PHP 30,000.00 as moral damages, PHP 20,000.00 as exemplary damages, and PHP 10,000.00 as attorney's fees. We retain the payment of PHP 17,360.00 in favor of Atty. Corpus as cost of suit. All monetary awards are subject to 6% interest per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 24, 2022 and the Resolution dated May 30, 2023 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 115943 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.\n\nPetitioner Jose P. Singh is liable for malicious prosecution. He is ordered to pay Atty. Perfecto S. Corpus, Jr. PHP 30,000.00 as moral damages, PHP 20,000.00 as exemplary damages, PHP 10,000.00 as attorney's fees, and PHP 17,360.00 as cost of suit.\n\nThese monetary awards shall earn 6% interest per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nLeonen, SAJ.

HEIRS OF BURGOS MALAYA, REPRESENTED BY CAESAR SAUL MALAYA, PURIFICACION MALAYA, GINA M. MERANO, CHEREMIE MERANO, AND REGIE MALAYA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nLEONEN, SAJ.:\n\nCultivating the land of another does not automatically mean that an agricultural leasehold relation arises between the tiller and the landowner. The party claiming to be an agricultural lessee must show that the elements of an agricultural leasehold are present to be afforded protection under our agrarian laws.\n\nThis Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Decision[2] and Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board rulings[4] finding that there is no agricultural leasehold relation between the parties.\n\nIn 1952, Leodegario Musico (Musico) served as caretaker of a cocoland owned by Domingo Gutierrez (Gutierrez) in Romblon, Romblon. When Gutierrez died, his daughter, Araceli Gutierrez-Orola (Orola), took over the management of their property.[5]\n\nSometime later, Musico moved to Manila to work as a foreperson for Orola's husband. Musico's daughter Florsita and her husband, Ulderico Rodeo (the Rodeo spouses), continued to take care of Gutierrez's land. When Orola died, Gutierrez's grandson, Burgos Malaya (Burgos), was appointed as administrator of the estate.[6]\n\nUpon Burgos's death, his heirs, represented by Reynaldo M. Malaya, entered into a Kasunduan[7] with the Rodeo spouses. It allowed the Rodeo Spouses to reside in the property for free while taking care of the land.[8]\n\nIn 2009, one of Burgos's children, Ceasar Saul Malaya, allegedly ordered the Rodeo spouses to vacate the property. He also asked his relatives to harvest the coconuts without the consent of Florsita or Ulderico.[9]\n\nAs such, the Rodeo spouses filed a Complaint[10] before the Office of the Provincial Adjudicator, claiming they were bona fide tenants of the property, and thus, entitled to the security of tenure.[11]\n\nThe Complaint filed was decided by the Office of the Regional Adjudicator. In its Decision,[12] the Office of the Regional Adjudicator dismissed the Complaint for lack of merit.[13] It found that the Rodeo spouses failed to establish all the elements of a tenancy relationship, particularly the requisite that there be sharing of harvests of the property. It also noted that the Rodeo spouses filed the case not against the landowner, but only against the heirs of Burgos, who used to be the administrator of the property.[14] Moreover, the Rodeo spouses could not state the ratio of the sharing of harvests between them and the heirs of Burgos.[15]\n\nOn appeal by the Rodeo spouses,[16] the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board issued a Decision[17] on January 29, 2019, affirming the ruling. It likewise held that the Rodeo spouses failed to establish all the elements of a tenancy relationship. Aside from the missing element of sharing of harvest, it also found lacking the element of consent by the landowner. It ruled that the Rodeo spouses' cultivation was only germane to fulfilling their obligations as caretakers of the land. Absent consent and sharing of harvests, the Rodeo spouses were only cultivators of the property.[18]\n\nThe Board found that Musico himself was not a tenant; as such, the Rodeo spouses cannot succeed as tenants.[19] It also ruled that they cannot claim that they are tenants in their own right since they could not produce any piece of evidence that there was sharing of harvests.[20]\n\nIn its September 29, 2021 Decision,[21] the Court of Appeals denied the Petition for Review filed by the Rodeo spouses. Again, it found that they failed to establish the elements of consent and sharing of harvests and that they were not installed as tenants under the Kasunduan.[22]\n\nIn a September 19, 2022 Resolution,[23] the Court of Appeals denied the Rodeo spouses' Motion for Partial Reconsideration.[24]\n\nThus, the Rodeo spouses filed their Petition[25] before this Court against the heirs of Burgos. They argue that there is a written implied tenancy between the parties in the Kasunduan, and that they had cultivated the land and shared the harvest with respondents.[26]\n\nIn their Comment,[27] respondents counter that there is no agricultural leasehold relationship.[28] They add that the lower tribunals have already settled the issues raised by petitioners.[29]\n\nThis Court resolves whether the Court of Appeals erred in denying the Petition for Review on the ground that there is no tenancy relationship between the parties.\n\nWe deny the Petition.\n\nI\n\nA look at the long history of agrarian laws in our country, and how they evolved from share tenancy to agricultural leasehold, is in order.\n\nBefore the Spanish colonial period, land ownership in the Philippines was through a communal system. The produce harvested from the land were shared equally. But this system of communal land ownership changed when the Spaniards arrived.[30] They \"purchased communal lands from heads of the different barangays and registered the lands in their names.\"[31] Then, all lands not privately owned were deemed owned by the State.[32]\n\nThe Spanish colonial period also introduced the encomienda system.[33] The caretaker of the land was called the encomendero. Natives who tilled the lands under the encomienda system could not own the land or its produce. Instead, they were required \"to pay tribute to their encomenderos.\"[34]\n\nThe hacienda system was like the encomienda system. Those who tilled the hacienda could also not own the land or its produce despite their hard work. It was a system of forced labor, akin to slavery.[35]\n\nVestiges of the encomienda and hacienda systems could be seen in our earlier agricultural tenancy laws.\n\nAct No. 4054, or the Philippine Rice Share Tenancy Act, defined the contract of share tenancy as \"one whereby a partnership between a landlord and a tenant is entered into, for a joint pursuit of rice agricultural work with common interest in which both parties divide between them the resulting profits as well as the losses.\"[36] In Pineda v. Pingul,[37] this Court explained the policy behind the law:\nThe Rice Share Tenancy Law, Act No. 4054, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 178 and Republic Act No. 34, intended to protect the interests of both the landlord and the tenant, without infringing upon or curtailing the proprietary rights of the landlord or owner, was undoubtedly conceived mainly to redeem the tenant from his life of misery, want and oftentimes oppression, arising from onerous terms of his tenancy. Side by side with this objective, and in obedience to the declared principle of promoting social justice to insure the well-being and economic security of all the people (Constitution, Article 11, Section 5), and to the mandate to afford protection to labor and to regulate the relations between landowner and tenant (Constitution, Article XIV, Section 6), the Rice Share Tenancy Law was also aimed at the upliftment of the social and financial status of the tenant.[38]\nAct No. 4054, as amended, was eventually superseded by Republic Act No. 1199, which classified agricultural tenancy into either leasehold tenancy or share tenancy. Section 4 states:\nSECTION 4. Systems of Agricultural Tenancy; Their Definitions. — Agricultural tenancy is classified into leasehold tenancy and share tenancy.\n\nShare tenancy exists whenever two persons agree on a joint undertaking for agricultural production wherein one party furnishes the land and the other his labor, with either or both contributing any one or several of the items of production, the tenant cultivating the land personally with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, and the produce thereof to be divided between the landholder and the tenant in proportion to their respective contributions.\n\nLeasehold tenancy exists when a person who, either personally or with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, undertakes to cultivate a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation by a single person together with members of his immediate farm household, belonging to or legally possessed by, another in consideration of a price certain or ascertainable to be paid by the person cultivating the land either in percentage of the production or in a fixed amount in money, or in both.\nThe definition of leasehold tenancy was amended in Republic Act No. 2263. Section 4, as amended, states:\nLeasehold tenancy exists when a person who, either personally or with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, undertakes to cultivate a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation by a single person together with members of his immediate farm household, belonging to or legally possessed by, another in consideration of a fixed amount in money or in produce or in both. (Emphasis supplied)\nAs the years passed, it became apparent that share tenancy did not work in favor of the tenant-farmers.[39] In 1963, Republic Act No. 3844, or the Agricultural Land Reform Code, was signed into law. It abolished agricultural share tenancy, declaring it as contrary to public policy.[40] Republic Act No. 6389 later amended Republic Act No. 3844 and converted all existing contracts of share tenancy into agricultural leasehold.[41]\n\nThe main difference between agricultural leasehold and share tenancy is that an agricultural leasehold relation is not extinguished \"by mere expiration of the term or period in a leasehold contract nor by the sale, alienation or transfer of the legal possession of the landholding.\"[42] It also allows the lessee to purchase the land tilled because it provides for a lessee's right of preemption[43] and redemption,[44] as the case may be.\n\nIn 2009, Republic Act No. 9700 repealed Section 53 of Republic Act No. 3844.[45] Other than that, the provisions of Republic Act No. 3844 not expressly repealed and remain consistent with subsequent laws still have suppletory effect.\n\nThe most recent agrarian reform law is Republic Act No. 11953, or the New Agrarian Emancipation Act. The law condones the principal debt of agrarian reform beneficiaries subject to certain requirements.[46] It also protects the rights to just compensation of landowners whose agricultural lands were subjected to the agrarian reform program.[47]\n\nOur agrarian reform laws primarily aim to uplift the lives of agricultural lessees while recognizing the rights of landowners to have a share in the harvest or to receive a fixed amount of money.\n\nII\n\nHaving looked at the history of our agrarian reform laws, we now discuss the merits of the Petition.\n\nThis Court is not a trier of facts. In cases where the issue involves questions of fact, the findings of administrative agencies in the performance of their official duties and exercise of their primary jurisdiction are generally binding upon this Court.[48] This Court is simply not in the best position to review their factual findings.[49]\n\nIn this case, petitioners urge this Court to revisit the very facts already settled by all three lower tribunals. The issue of tenancy, that is, whether a person is an agricultural tenant, is a question of fact.[50] All being triers of facts,[51] the lower courts are in a position to assess the parties' evidence and determine whether there is substantial evidence to uphold the claims of one party over the other. The Court of Appeals itself has the power to reverse or modify the rulings of the agrarian reform bodies, but instead it affirmed them in the case. Accordingly, their uniform findings bind this Court, as a general rule. Exceptions to this rule exist.\n\nIII\n\nHowever, even if this case were an exception to the general rule to permit a factual review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, we are constrained to affirm the rulings of the lower tribunals.\n\nThe requisites of a valid agricultural leasehold relationship are settled:\nFor a tenancy relationship, express or implied, to exist, the following requisites must be present: (1) the parties must be landowner and tenant or agricultural lessee; (2) the subject matter is agricultural land; (3) there is consent by the landowner; (4) the purpose is agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation by the tenant; and (6) there is sharing of harvests between the landowner and the tenant.[52] (Citation omitted)\nEach of the elements must be proved by independent and concrete evidence, not mere conjectures or presumptions.[53] Moreover, it is basic that one who alleges must prove their case.[54]\n \nIn this case, we affirm the Court of Appeals' ruling that the elements of consent and sharing of harvests are wanting. Petitioners failed to prove that they are agricultural lessees.\n\nFirst, petitioners alleged that they were agricultural lessees, but the facts narrated in their Petition consistently show that they were caretakers. They admitted that they were required to inform respondents whenever there was a harvest, but they never discussed any harvest-sharing agreement.[55]\n\nSecond, a plain reading of the Kasunduan reveals that it contains no stipulation regarding the landowner's consent for the agricultural leasehold relationship and the sharing of harvests between the parties. The material stipulations in the Kasunduan are reproduced below:\nPumapayag ang Unang Panig na tumira ang Ikalawang Panig sa Lot 4310, Barangay Ginablan, Romblon, Romblon, na pag-aari ng yumaong si Burgos G. Malaya, nang libre at walang upa;\n....\nBilang pagtanaw ng utang na loob sa Unang Panig sa kagandahang[]loob at pagpayag na tumira ang Ikalawang Panig sa lupang ito nang libre at walang upa, pumapayag ang Ikalawang Panig na pangalagaan, pagyamanin, at bantayan ang lupang ito.\n\nMakapag-aalaga ng \"livestock\" [manok, baboy, itik, atbp.] ang Ikalawang Panig sa lupang ito, basta't payag ang Unang Panig. Pananatilihin ng Ikalawang Panig na malinis at ligtas ang lupang naturan. Ang anumang anihin ng lupa, maging halaman o \"livestock\" man ay ipagbibigay-alam ng Ikalawang Panig sa Unang Panig.[56]\nThe Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board correctly held that while petitioners were indeed allowed to cultivate the land, this was only necessary for them to fulfill their obligations under the Kasunduan.[57] It cannot be interpreted as amounting to the landowner's consent to install them as tenants of the property. Indeed, respondents acted at once when they learned that petitioners were cultivating the land and selling the harvest without informing them, in violation of the terms of the Kasunduan.[58]\n\nSpouses Franco v. Spouses Galera[59] instructs that a \"tenancy relationship can be implied when the conduct of the parties shows the presence of all the requisites under the law.\"[60] However, in this case, the conduct of the parties disproves the existence of an agricultural leasehold. Petitioners, despite allegedly being the agricultural lessees for several decades, were unable to prove that there was sharing of harvests. As noted by the Office of the Regional Adjudicator, petitioners could not state how the harvests were divided between the landowner and the agricultural lessee.[61] Moreover, all tribunals below found that petitioners failed to provide receipts evidencing sharing of harvests.[62] These findings cannot be disturbed, unless we become a trier of facts. Again, questions or facts are beyond the jurisdiction of this Court in a Rule 45 petition.\n\nAs agricultural tenancy is never presumed,[63] petitioners' failure to adduce evidence showing all the requisites of tenancy destroys their cause.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DENIED. The September 29, 2021 Decision and September 19, 2022 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 160900 are AFFIRMED. The case is dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nLazaro-Javier, M. Lopez, and J.
