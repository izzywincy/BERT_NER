{"id":933,"text":"FIRST DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 246793, March 18, 2021 ]\nHCL TECHNOLOGIES PHILIPPINES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. FRANCISCO AGRAVIADOR GUARIN, JR., RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nCARANDANG, J.:\nBefore this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by petitioner HCL Technologies Philippines, Inc. (HCL) assailing the Decision dated January 29,2019 and Resolution dated April 17, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 154699. The CA affirmed the Decision dated October 30, 2017 and the Resolution dated December 19, 2017 of the National Labor Relations Commission TLRC) in NLRC LAC No. 09-003090-17 with the modification that the monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of the Decision until full satisfaction. The NLRC partially affirmed the Decision dated June 30, 2017 of the Labor Arbiter (LA) in NLRC NCR Case Nos. 02-00014-17.\nAntecedents\nHCL, a business process outsourcing (BPO) company, hired respondent Francisco A. Guarin, Jr. (Guarin, Jr.) on November 11, 2013 as its senior technical support officer and assigned him to the account of one of its clients, Salesforce.com Inc. (Salesforce). Guarin, Jr. was tasked to provide technical support to its administrators and users. On July 5, 2016, Salesforce informed HCL that it will no longer require its services effective October 15, 2016. Thereafter, HCL informed Guarin, Jr. that he had three options: (1) file an application with Accenture; (2) find a suitable position in HCL, specifically with the account of its other client, Google; or (3) resign. The two available positions in the Google account were support engineer for the app engine and support engineer for the computer engine. Guarin, Jr. sent his resume for the Google account positions after the deadline for its submission has lapsed.\nSubsequently, Guarin, Jr. was directed not to return to work beginning October 1, 2016. In a letter dated October 15, 2016, HCL informed Guarin, Jr. that his position has become redundant and his last working day shall be on November 15, 2016. Guarin, Jr. signed a release, waiver, and quitclaim acknowledging his receipt of P182,340. from HCL. Nonetheless, he filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, monetary claims, damages, and attorney's fees against HCL and its officers Roopesh Mishra and Blanca Grace Vila.\nRuling of the Labor Arbiter\nOn June 30, 2017, the LA rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:\n1. declaring Complainant to have been illegally dismissed;\n2. ordering Respondent HCL to pay full back wages to be computed from the time of dismissal until the finality of this Decision;\n3. ordering Respondent HCL to pay Complainant moral and exemplary damages equivalent to P50,000. each or for an aggregate amount of P100,000. and attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total award.\nAttached is the computation which shall form part of this Decision.\nOther claims are denied for lack of merit.\nSO ORDERED. (Emphasis in the original)\nUnder Article 298 of Presidential Decree No. 442, also known as the Labor Code of the Philippines, redundancy is an authorized cause for termination provided the following requisites are met: (1) the employer must serve a written notice to the affected employees and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) at least one month before the intended day of retrenchment; (2) the employer must pay the employees a separation pay equivalent to at least one month pay or at least one month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher; (3) the employer must abolish the redundant positions in good faith; and (4) the employer must set fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining which positions are redundant and may be abolished. The LA held that HCL was only able to satisfy the first two requisites. Based on HCL's website, it is the \"world's fastest growing IT services brand operating in at least 32 countries with various alliances.\" HCL did not satisfactorily explain why the departure of one client already resulted in the redundancy of some of its employees when it has other clients. HCL also failed to show that it conducted an evaluation or study on the viability of its redundancy program. Further, the LA could not understand why Guarin, Jr., who was a regular employee, was even required to submit his resume for the Google account positions when it was HCL's duty to find a new position for him. Also, the fact that there were available positions in the Google account means that there were positions that Guarin, Jr. could have been transferred to. With respect to the release, quitclaim, and waiver, the LA ruled that it cannot be enforced because Guarin, Jr.'s dismissal was illegal and his consent was vitiated. by fraud or mistake. He was misled that that the redundancy program was legal.\nConsidering that Guarin, Jr. already received his separation package, the LA held that it would be inequitable to order his reinstatement. With respect to the other claims of Guarin, Jr. such as underpayment of 13th month pay and non-payment of salary, the LA denied it because he neither discussed it nor proved his entitlement to it. Guarin, Jr.'s prayer to hold the individual officers of HCL solidarily liable was likewise denied. However, the LA his prayer for moral and exemplary damages meritorious because of the illegality of his termination. The LA also granted Guarin, Jr.'s prayer for attorney's fees because he was compelled to litigate and incur expenses to protect his rights and interest.\nBoth parties appealed to the NLRC. Guarin, Jr. averred that the LA committed an oversight in the computation of the backwages awarded to him. HCL argued that the LA erred in ruling that Guarin, Jr. was illegally dismissed and that he is entitled to his monetary claims.\nRuling of the National Labor Relations Commission\nThe NLRC partially granted the appeals of both parties in its Decision, dated October 30, 2017 to wit:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the Appeals of the complainant and respondents are hereby PARTIALLY GRANTED and the assailed Decision by the Labor Arbiter Jasper Z. Dela Cruz dated 28 April 2017 is hereby MODIFIED with regard to the amount of the judgment award.\nThe monetary award is hereby computed as follows:\n1.) Basic Salary 11\/15\/16-10\/25\/17 35,644. x 11.\nSO ORDERED. (Emphasis in the original.)\nAt the onset, the NLRC clarified that both parties filed their appeal on time, or within 10 days from their receipt of the Decision of the LA. Both parties also paid the required fees for their appeal. The NLRC agreed with the LA that while HCL complied with the procedural due process requirements, it failed to satisfy the last two requisites for terminating an employee on the ground of redundancy. There is no document proving the redundancy or the abolition of Guarin, Jr.'s position as senior technical support officer. It was likewise not shown what criteria HCL used in deciding to phase out such position. The fact that there were available positions in HCL's Google account shows that Guarin, Jr.'s position was not truly phased out. Moreover, the employment contract itself states that Guarin, Jr. may be transferred to any of HCL's group company clients without the need for him to submit an application for his transfer. As for the quitclaim, the NLRC ruled that HCL failed to prove that it was voluntarily executed by Guarin, Jr. Guarin, Jr. is therefore not precluded from filing a complaint against HCL.\nThe NLRC concurred with the LA that Guarin, Jr. can no longer be reinstated because he received his separation pay. But he is entitled to receive backwages from the time of his dismissal until the finality of the Decision. The NLRC deleted the award of moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees, because there was no finding of bad faith on the part of HCL. HCL filed a motion for reconsideration which the NLRC denied. Thereafter, HCL filed a petition for certiorari with the CA.\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\nThe CA affirmed the ruling of the NLRC in its January 29, 2019 Decision but modified its ruling as follows:\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED . The October 30, 2017 Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission, 3rd Division, in NLRC LAC No. 09-003090-17, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that the monetary awards shall earn an interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full satisfaction.\nSO ORDERED. (Emphasis in the original.)\nThe CA concurred with the NLRC and the LA that HCL only proved its compliance with the first two requisites for termination due to redundancy but not the last two requisites, namely, good faith in abolishing the redundant positions and a fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining what positions are to be declared redundant. The employment contract shows that Guarin, Jr. was HCL's employee regardless of whether Salesforce remained the latter's client. HCL could have transferred him to the Google account but did not do so. In addition, HCL failed to substantiate its redundancy program or show that it used fair and reasonable criteria in determining which positions should be abolished.\nAccording to the CA, the quitclaim executed by Guarin, Jr. is invalid because HCL employed fraud or deceit in obtaining it. HCL's redundancy program was not done in good faith. HCL was determined to sever Guarin, Jr.'s employment and the latter had no choice but to sign the quitclaim. Guarin, Jr.'s educational attainment is immaterial because he was constrained to sign after being faced with the prospect of unemployment and financial offers.\nThe CA held that Guarin, Jr. is entitled to the monetary awards granted by the NLRC because he was illegally dismissed. Following the ruling in the case of Nacar v. Gallery Frames, legal interest must likewise be imposed on all the monetary awards.\nHCL filed a motion for reconsideration but the CA denied it As such, HCL filed a petition for review on certiorari before this Court to assail the ruling of the CA. According to HCL, it is undisputed that it gave timely notice to Guarin, Jr. and the DOLE. It also paid the separation pay mandated by law. With respect to the requirements of good faith and fair and reasonable criteria, HCL argued that first, the phasing out of a service previously undertaken is a valid cause to declare a position redundant. In this case, HCL hires employees based on the specific needs of each of its clients. When Salesforce decided to .end its contract, Guarin, Jr.'s services became unnecessary. HCL could not simply transfer him to another client who has a different set of requirements and a fixed number of personnel. HCL insists that the characterization of an employee's services as no longer necessary is an exercise of business judgment that cannot be reviewed except when the law is violated or the action is malicious and arbitrary. There is no proof that HCL acted in bad faith in abolishing the redundant positions. HCL submitted sufficient proof of the redundancy of Guarin, Jr.'s position.\nSecond, the positions in the Google account were the only available positions for Guarin, Jr. HCL cannot be faulted for giving those positions to other employees in the Salesforce account who were not only better qualified but timely submitted their applications as well. HCL pointed out that as a BPO company, the employee headcount for each of its clients is fixed by contract. It cannot simply add employees to another account without the consent of its client. In addition, the employee must meet the specific requirements for that account. Third, HCL averred that it only implemented its redundancy program after the vacant positions in its Google account were filled up. Since the remaining employees assigned to Salesforce were the only ones affected, there was no need for HCL to do a comparison. All their positions were abolished. Fourth, Guarin, Jr. executed a valid release, waiver, and quitclaim which is binding upon him. He cannot feign ignorance because he is a college graduate who has more or less 10 years of work experience. Given that Guarin, Jr. was validly dismissed, he is not entitled to any monetary award.\nGuarin, Jr. filed a comment wherein he stated that HCL simply rehashed its previous arguments and did not raise any error of judgment on the part of the CA. The LA, the NLRC, and the CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion in ruling that the requisites for a valid redundancy program are not present in this case. HCL hired Guarin, Jr. as its regular employee whose employment should not have been dependent on the retention and pullout of its clients. Moreover, there were vacant positions equivalent to the one occupied by Guarin, Jr. which he could have been transferred to. HCL did not present a new staffing pattern, feasibility study\/proposal, job description, and approval of the restriction by the management in support of its redundancy program. It did not even use criteria in determining which positions have become redundant. Further, Guarin, Jr. claimed that the Decision of the NLRC has attained finality.\nIssue\nThe issue in this case is whether the CA erred in affirming the NLRC and the LA that Guarin, Jr. was illegally dismissed.\nRuling of the Court\nWe grant the petition. Though the courts a quo uniformly ruled in favor of Guarin, Jr., their findings are erroneous based on the available facts. Hence, We must review the same.\nArticle 298 of the Labor Code allows the employer to terminate the employee on the ground of redundancy which exists when the service of an employee is in excess of what is reasonably demanded by the actual requirements of the business. The following are the requirements for a valid redundancy program: (1) written notice served on both the employees and the DOLE at least one month prior to the intended date of retrenchment; (2) payment of separation pay equivalent to at least one month pay or at least one month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher; (3) good faith in abolishing the redundant positions; and (4) fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining what positions are to be declared redundant and accordingly abolished.\nAll the foregoing requisites are present in this case. First, HCL sent an Establishment Termination Report to the DOLE on October 11, 2016. It notified Guarin, Jr. of his termination effective November 15, 2016 through a Letter dated October 15, 2016. Hence, HCL complied with the notice requirement.\nSecond, Guarin, Jr. acknowledged that he received P182,340. from HCL. Even the courts a quo acknowledged that Guarin, Jr. received his separation pay.\nThird, HCL exercised good faith and employed fair and reasonable criteria in abolishing Guarin, Jr.'s position. Good faith requires substantial proof that the services of the employees are in excess of what is required of the company. Guarin, Jr. was assigned to the account of Salesforce. His employment contract notably requires him to sign a client-specific non­disclosure agreement and obtain a certificate issued by Salesforce. Clearly then, Guarin, Jr. was hired by HCL specifically for its Salesforce account. However, Salesforce's account was terminated effective October 15, 2016. This rendered Guatin, Jr.'s position in HCL redundant. The very reason for his position has ceased to exist.\nTo HCL's credit, it informed Guarin, Jr. that he could apply for the positions of Support Engineer in the App Engine and the Computer Engine under the account of Google. ℒαwρhi৷ Guarin, Jr. failed to timely submit his application for these positions. As such, he cannot fault HCL for his failure to secure either of these positions. After the available positions in the Google account were given to two employees who were best-suited for it, HCL implemented its redundancy program. As such, apart from these two employees, all 51 employees assigned to Salesforce were laid off based on HCL's Establishment Termination Report, including Guarin, Jr.. HCL did not discriminate among its employees handling Salesforce's account.\nMoreover, Guarin, Jr. executed a release, waiver, and quitclaim in favor of HCL. Under the release, waiver, and quitclaim, Guarin, Jr. acknowledged that the sum of P182,340. he received from HCL is the full payment and final settlement of the overtime pay, salaries, commutable leaves, gratuities of any kind of compensation or emoluments, or any claims of whatever kind due to him arising from his employment. The said document also provides that \"I will institute no action, whether civil, criminal, or administrative against HCL TCHNOLOGIES PHILIPPINES INC., its directors, officers, employees, agents, and clients.\" Quitclaims are valid when they satisfy the following requisites: (1) that there was no fraud or deceit on the part of any of the parties; (2) that the consideration for the quitclaim is credible and reasonable; and (3) that the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law. If, however, there is clear proof that the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person; or the terms of settlement are unconscionable on their face, the quitclaim is invalid. Guarin, Jr. had a salary of P31,000.) per month. He worked for HCL for three years, and is thus entitled to a separation pay of P93,000.. HCL paid him P100,000. as separation pay, in addition to other amounts. Clearly then, the consideration given by HCL under the quitclaim was more than what is required by law.\nGuarin, Jr. assailed the quitclaim on the ground that \"he is a single Father of a 5 year old boy and on account of economic necessity that forced him to accept any amount without verifying the rudiments following thereto.\" While we commiserate with Guarin, Jr.'s concerns about providing for his family, this cannot be considered fraud or deceit on the part of HCL that would invalidate the quitclaim. In Coats Manila Bay, Inc. v. Ortega, We held that \"\"Dire necessity\" may be an acceptable ground to annul quitclaims if the consideration is unconscionably low and the employee was tricked into accepting it, but is not an acceptable ground for annulling the release when it is not shown that the employee has been forced to execute it.\" There is no proof that Guarin, Jr. was forced to sign the quitclaim. And as stated, HCL offered a reasonable amount to him. Hence, We cannot invalidate the quitclaim Guarin, Jr. signed solely because of his financial concerns.\nConsidering that HCL complied with all the requisites for terminating Guarin, Jr.'s employment on the ground of redundancy, his dismissal was valid. In addition, Guarin, Jr. executed a valid release, waiver and quitclaim. Consequently, Guarin, Jr. is not entitled to backwages, much more moral damages and attorney's fees. The CA therefore erred in affirming the ruling of the NRLC. Guarin, Jr.'s complaint is unmeritorious. As such, the CA's Decision and Resolution must be reversed and set aside.\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED . The Decision dated January 29, 2019 and the Resolution dated April 17, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 154699 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE . The complaint of respondent Francisco A. Guarin, Jr. is DISMISSED .\nSO ORDERED.\nPeralta, C.

{"id":934,"text":"THIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 234384, April 26, 2021 ]\nELISEO N. JOSEPH, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES JOSEFINA JOSEPH AND DANILO JOSEPH, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nLOPEZ, J., J.:\nThis is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Decision dated September 15, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR. CV No. 105625, which affirmed with modification the Decision dated July 28, 2015 rendered by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 172 of Valenzuela City in Civil Case No. 44-V-05, with the CA decreeing that the unpaid purchase price of the subject property in the amount of P30,000. shall earn interest at the rate of 12% per annum from May 20, 2005 until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until its full satisfaction; and that the moral damages and attorney's fees shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of the judgment until full satisfaction thereof.\nFACTS AND ANTECEDENT PROCEEDINGS\nRespondents Spouses Josefina and Danilo Joseph (respondents) are the registered owners of a parcel of land (subject property) situated in the Barrio of Balangcas, Valenzuela City, covered by TCT No. V-46412, and measuring Two Hundred Twenty Five square meters (225 sq. m.) more or less. On January 15, 2002, respondents and petitioner Eliseo Joseph (petitioner) entered into an Agreement to Sell of the subject property in consideration of the sum of Two Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P225,000.), with petitioner making a downpayment of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.) upon the signing of the contract and the balance of One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Pesos (P125,000.) shall be paid by petitioner within one year from and after the execution of the contract.\nAccording to petitioner, he was able to fully pay the agreed consideration of the subject property. Consequently, he demanded from respondents the execution of a deed of absolute sale in his favor, which was however signed only by respondent Josefina Joseph while respondent Danilo Joseph refused to sign the same unless petitioner pays an additional sum of money which is beyond the price agreed upon by the parties in their contract to sell. After exerting earnest efforts for amicable settlement, which proved futile, petitioner filed a complaint for specific performance and damages dated February 23, 2005 against respondents praying that they be ordered to execute a final deed of absolute sale concerning the subject property, in his favor.\nIn their Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim, respondents claimed that in addition to the purchase price of P225,000., the parties also agreed for petitioner to pay them an additional amount of Eighty Thousand Pesos (P80,000.), representing the value of the fence constructed by respondents around the subject property and the filling materials therein, before a Deed of Absolute Sale may be executed in favor of petitioner. After some negotiations, respondents agreed that petitioner will only pay an additional sum of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.) thus increasing the purchase price of the property to P255,000., from the original contract price of P225,000.. As such, a Deed of Absolute Sale for the price of P255,000. was drafted with the agreement that the balance of P30,000. will be paid by petitioner upon signing of the agreement. Respondents, however, claimed that with the refusal of petitioner to pay the amount of P30,000. despite repeated demands, their refusal to sign the Deed of Absolute Sale is justified.\nAfter the parties filed their respective pleadings, due proceedings were conducted, and in a Decision dated July 28, 2015, the RTC Branch 172 of Valenzuela City ruled in favor of respondents, disposing the case as follows:\nWHEREFORE , plaintiff is ordered to pay the defendants the unpaid additional purchase price of Php30,000. within ten (10) days upon finality of this decision and for the defendants to execute the deed of absolute sale immediately thereafter in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff is further directed to pay the defendants the amount of Php50,000. as moral damages and Php50,000. as attorney's fees and costs of litigation.\nSO ORDERED.\nAggrieved, petitioner brought an appeal before the Court of Appeals, which was denied.\nThe CA found that the consideration of the sale of the subject property in the amount of P225,000. was increased by the parties to P255,000.. Respondents repeatedly claimed that they entered into an agreement with petitioner to increase the purchase price of the subject property by P30,000., corresponding to the expenses incurred for the improvements made on the subject property. Aside therefrom, the Deed of Absolute Sale prepared by petitioner and the letter of demand he sent to respondents show that he explicitly claimed that he already paid in full the purchase price of P255,000.. Such fact was even admitted by him during his testimony in court.\nThe CA also held that the Statute of Frauds is no longer applicable since the contract has already been partially consummated. It found that the verbal amendment of the contract to sell, increasing the purchase price of the subject property to P255,000., had already been partially executed through the partial payments made by petitioner and received by respondents. Petitioner had, on separate occasions, paid P100,000. to respondents and P125,000. to the bank. Thus, the contract is no longer within the purview of the Statute of Frauds.\nIn ruling that petitioner is liable to pay respondents a sum of money, the CA declared that petitioner submitted receipts totaling P94,810.. When added to the P100,000. downpayment, it would appear that the purchase price was not paid in full. What is being disputed is that the remaining P30,000. has already been paid by petitioner. Since no other evidence was offered to prove that petitioner was able to pay in full the purchase price of P255,000., the CA concluded that the remaining balance of P30,000. remains unsettled. As it was the petitioner who filed the complaint against respondents before the RTC, it was incumbent upon him to prove full payment of the amount of P255,000. by preponderance of evidence. This, he failed to do so.\nThe CA likewise affirmed the award of moral damages and attorney's fees in favor of respondents and modified the award of damages in accordance with the case of Nacar v. Gallery Frames, ultimately disposing the case as follows:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the Appeal is DENIED . The Decision dated July 28, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 172, Valenzuela City, in Civil Case No. 44-V-05 is AFFIRMED with the Modification that the unpaid purchase price of the subject property in the amount of P30,000. shall earn interest at the rate of 12% per annum from May 30, 2005 until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until its full satisfaction; and that the moral damages and attorney's fees shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of the judgment until full satisfaction thereof.\nSO ORDERED.\nAggrieved, petitioner brought the instant petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 seeking to reverse the CA Decision.\nOn the part of the respondents, after filing a series of extensions to file Comment, they were able to file their Comment to the petition on June 27, 2018, echoing the CA Decision, principally arguing that the very Deed of Absolute Sale which petitioner seeks to be signed by respondents states that the consideration for the sale is P255,000.. Likewise, the letter from petitioner's counsel admits that the consideration for the sale is P255,000.. Further, the testimony of petitioner during trial showed that he admitted that there were improvements, although dilapidated, that were already existing on the subject property when the parties agreed on its sale. Having no cause of action, petitioner was not justified in bringing suit against respondents; thus, the award of moral damages, attorney's fees and costs of suit was proper.\nISSUES\nThe issues brought forth by petitioner are the following:\nI.\nWhether the Court of Appeals gravely erred in ruling that there was a subsequent agreement between the parties increasing the consideration by Thirty Thousand Pesos, thus making him liable therefor\nII.\nWhether the Court of Appeals gravely erred in ruling that petitioner is liable to pay respondents moral damages, attorney's fees and costs of litigation\nRULING\nThe petition lacks merit.\nRule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court provides a party with the remedy of filing a verified petition for review before this Court when seeking to assail a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, which petition shall raise only questions of law that must be distinctly set forth. Consistent therewith, it has been held that it is not this Court's function to once again analyze or weigh evidence that has already been considered in the lower courts.\nA question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the [question] posed is one of fact. Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact.\nIn the instant case, it is the amount of P30,000. as an additional amount to the consideration in the sale of the subject property that is being contested by petitioner. As argued by petitioner, the P30,000. increase of the consideration was not due to improvements (e.g. fencing and filling) made thereon. Petitioner claims that except for the respondents' allegations, nothing in the records would show that there were, in fact, improvements made after the execution of the Contract to Sell. Petitioner averred that it is highly unlikely that after the respondents have already contracted to sell the subject property to the petitioner, and with the latter actually paying for part of the consideration, the former would subsequently, without the consent of petitioner, introduced improvements on the subject property.\nPetitioner adds that the respondents never denied receipt of the letter of demand from the petitioner asking for the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale by reason of full payment. If he has not yet, in fact, paid for the full price, then it would have been more in accordance with human nature and experience for the respondents to have denied, in writing, full payment of the contract price and, at the same time, to mention the increase of the contract price as a result of the alleged improvements. However, this was not the case.\nAll of the arguments raised by petitioner are factual in nature, which requires a re-examination of the evidence presented during trial. The issue of whether full payment was indeed made by petitioner requires the presentation of relevant and competent evidence to produce proof that would satisfy the burden of proof that a party bears. This falls outside the ambit of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. Time and again, it has been held that the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts. The function of the Court in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts. As a matter of sound practice and procedure, the Court defers and accords finality to the factual findings of trial courts. To do otherwise would defeat the very essence of Rule 45 and would convert the Court into a trier of facts, which is not its intended purpose under the law.\nNonetheless, there are recognized exceptions to the rule that petitions filed under Rule 45 shall only be limited to questions of law, which are as follows:\n(1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures;\n(2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible;\n(3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion;\n(4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;\n(5) When the findings of fact are conflicting;\n(6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;\n(7) The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court;\n(8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;\n(9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and\n(10) The finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record.\nThese exceptions similarly apply in petitions for review filed before this court involving civil, labor, tax, or criminal cases.\nNone of the exceptions apply to the case of petitioner. Rather than presenting arguments in support of any of the aforementioned exceptions, petitioner harps on speculations, theorizing why respondent Danilo did not want to sign the Deed of Absolute Sale. According to petitioner, the fact that he has already fully paid the contract price was bolstered by the fact that respondent Josefina had already signed the Deed of Absolute Sale on January 6, 2005. Petitioner claimed that it even appears that respondent Danilo's refusal to sign was an afterthought to extort more money from him. Petitioner also alleged that the increase in the price was due to the payment of mortgage on the subject property he has made in excess of the contract price. In support thereof, petitioner averred that the TCT introduced in evidence shows several annotations pertaining to previous mortgages on the subject property cancelled by a subsequent mortgage obtained by the petitioner and his live-in partner in 2004, the year the Deed of Absolute Sale appears to have been drafted.\nExplaining the motive behind the alleged non-performance of an obligation is not for this Court to rule upon. These are matters for the trial court to consider based upon the appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties. In any case, proceeding with the petition will not result in the reversal of the assailed CA Decision.\nThe settled rule is that one who pleads payment has the burden of proving it. Even where the creditor alleges non-payment, the general rule is that the onus rests on the debtor to prove payment, rather than on the creditor to prove non-payment. The debtor has the burden of showing with legal certainty that the obligation has been discharged by payment. Where the debtor introduces some evidence of payment, the burden of going forward with the evidence  as distinct from the general burden of proof  shifts to the creditor, who is then under a duty of producing some evidence to show non-payment.\nIn this case, petitioner is the debtor who pleads full payment of the purchase price of the subject property. As such, it is he who carries the burden to prove his allegation of full payment. Whether the increase of P30,000. was due to the improvements introduced by the respondents or due to the payment of mortgage on the subject property, the trial court, as affirmed by the CA, already found, based on the evidence presented by the parties that the total amount of the consideration in the sale of the subject property is P255,000.. Thus, it is the full payment of this amount which petitioner must show, not the purpose for which the increase was attributed. ℒαwρhi৷ This, petitioner failed to do.\nIt bears noting that the Agreement to Sell dated January 15, 2002 which was entered into by the parties, with an agreed price of P225,000. already amounted to a binding contract between them. It is in the nature of a contract to sell, which is defined as \"a bilateral contract whereby the prospective seller, while expressly reserving the ownership of the subject property despite delivery thereof to the prospective buyer, binds himself to sell the said property exclusively to the prospective buyer upon fulfillment of the condition agreed upon, that is, full payment of the purchase price.\" In a contract to sell, \"ownership is retained by the seller and is not to pass until the full payment of the price x x x.\" It is \"commonly entered into so as to protect the seller against a buyer who intends to buy the property in installments by withholding ownership over the property until the buyer effects full payment therefor.\"\nWhile a contract to sell operates as a preparatory contract to the execution of a written contract of sale because of the condition for which the parties may agree on, it is already a contract in itself for which a meeting of the minds already exists. The consent, object and consideration of the contract are already present. Thus, the obligatory nature of a contract, which stresses the binding effect of the terms agreed upon by the parties as having the force of law between them, which should be complied with in good faith already becomes applicable. Nonetheless, considering the nature of a contract to sell, which creates a period for the other party to comply with his\/her obligation, there still remains a room for negotiation with respect to the terms already agreed upon. Any change in the terms of the agreement cannot however be unilaterally imposed by a single party; the same must be mutually agreed upon by the parties. This is consistent with the characteristic of autonomy of contracts, which allows the parties to establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem appropriate provided only that they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy. The standard norm in the performance of their respective covenants in the contract, as well as in the exercise of their rights thereunder, is expressed in the cardinal principle that the parties in that juridical relation must act with justice, honesty and good faith.\nMaintaining the essence of a contract, which is the meeting of the minds of the parties, agreements which may be subsequently entered into by the parties must be consensually agreed upon. As in this case, the purchase price originally agreed upon at P225,000. was increased to P255,000. as stated in the Deed of Absolute Sale. The Rules of Court recognizes the possibility that an agreement already entered into by the parties may still undergo changes. The Parol Evidence Rule provides an exception to the existence of other agreements entered into by the parties, to wit:\n3. Parol Evidence Rule\nSection 10. Evidence of written agreements.  When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing, it is considered as containing all the terms agreed upon and there can be, as between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of such terms other than the contents of the written agreement.\nHowever, a party may present evidence to modify, explain or add to the terms of the written agreement if he or she puts in issue in a verified pleading:\n(a) An intrinsic ambiguity, mistake or imperfection in the written agreement;\n(b) The failure of the written agreement to express the true intent and agreement of the parties thereto;\n(c) The validity of the written agreement; or\n(d) The existence of other terms agreed to by the parties or their successors in interest after the execution of the written agreement.\nThe term \"agreement\" includes wills. (9a)\nIn this case, while the Deed of Absolute Sale did not specifically indicate that it amends the Agreement to Sell that was first agreed upon by the parties, the same subject property, which is the object of the two contracts were alluded to. Neither petitioner nor respondent even assailed the purchase price that was in the Deed of Absolute Sale. As found by the Court of Appeals, the evidence of petitioner, specifically the Deed of Sale and the demand letter indicates that the amount of the subject property is P255,000..\nIt was, therefore, incumbent for petitioner to show proof that he fully paid this amount as subsequently agreed upon by the parties, before asking the respondents to execute a Deed of Absolute Sale and the delivery of the subject property to him. A contract of sale gives rise to a reciprocal obligation of the parties. Reciprocal obligations are those which arise from the same cause, and wherein each party is a debtor and a creditor of the other, such that the obligation of one is dependent upon the obligation of the other. They are to be performed simultaneously, so that the performance of one is conditioned upon the simultaneous fulfillment of the other. With his failure to perform his obligation, petitioner cannot compel the respondents to comply with their obligation.\nAnent the award of moral damages and attorney's fees, this Court resolves to delete the awards bestowed upon the respondents.\nThe award of moral damages is proper when the following circumstances concur: (1) there is an injury, whether physical, mental or psychological, clearly sustained by the claimant; (2) there is a culpable act or omission factually established; (3) the wrongful act or omission of the defendant is the proximate cause of the injury sustained by the claimant; and (4) the award of damages is predicated on any of the cases stated in Article 2219. This article provides:\nArt. 2219. Moral damages may be recovered in the following and analogous cases:\n(1) A criminal offense resulting in physical injuries;\n(2) Quasi-delicts causing physical injuries;\n(3) Seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts;\n(4) Adultery or concubinage;\n(5) Illegal or arbitrary detention or arrest;\n(6) Illegal search;\n(7) Libel, slander or any other form of defamation;\n(8) Malicious prosecution;\n(9) Acts mentioned in Article 309;\n(10) Acts and actions referred to in Articles 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, and 35.\nThe parents of the female seduced, abducted, raped, or abused, referred to in No. 3 of this article, may also recover moral damages.\nThe spouse, descendants, ascendants, and brothers and sisters may bring the action mentioned in No. 9 of this article, in the order named.\nIn awarding moral damages, the CA found that petitioner maliciously filed the complaint because he knew that he had a pending payment before filing the case. The circumstances of the case nonetheless show that petitioner believed that he had already fully paid the purchase price. While he may have failed to present evidence to prove his allegations, this does not equate to bad faith. Petitioner even attached to his pleadings, evidence demanding the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale with the amount of P255,000.. Petitioner did not attempt to make any alteration in the amount of the consideration that was subsequently agreed upon to make it appear that he already made full payment. As held in Delos Santos v. Papa:\nx x x The award of moral damages is not a legal consequence that automatically followed. Moral damages are only awarded if the basis therefor, as provided in the law quoted above, is duly established. In the present case, the ground the respondents invoked and failed to establish is malicious prosecution. Crystal v. Bank of the Philippine Islands is instructive on this point, as it tells us that the law never intended to impose a penalty on the right to litigate so that the filing of an unfounded suit does not automatically entitle the defendant to moral damages:\nThe spouses' complaint against BPI proved to be unfounded, but it does not automatically entitle BPI to moral damages. Although the institution of a clearly unfounded civil suit can at times be a legal justification for an award of attorney's fees, such filing, however, has almost invariably been held not to be a ground for an award of moral damages. The rationale for the rule is that the law could not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to litigate. Otherwise, moral damages must every time be awarded in favor of the prevailing defendant against an unsuccessful plaintiff.\nIn the same vein, the award of attorney's fees must, likewise, be deleted. It is a rule that the award of attorney's fees is the exception rather than the general rule, and \"counsel's fees are not to be awarded every time a party wins a suit. The discretion of the court to award attorney's fees under Article 2208 of the Civil Code demands factual, legal, and equitable justification, without which the award is a conclusion without a premise, its basis being improperly left to speculation and conjecture. In all events, the court must state the reason for the award of attorney's fees.\" None of the circumstances justifying an award of attorney's fees enumerated under Art. 2008 of the Civil Code are present, or have been proven in this case.\nWHEREFORE , the instant petition is DENIED . The Decision dated September 15, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 105625 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION hereby DELETING the award of moral damages and attorney's fees in favor of respondents Spouses Josefina and Danilo Joseph. Petitioner Eliseo Joseph shall pay the respondents Spouses Josefina and Danilo Joseph the unpaid purchase price of the subject property in the amount of P30,000., which shall earn interest at the rate of 12% per annum from May 30, 2005 until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until its full satisfaction.\nSO ORDERED.\nLeonen (Chairperson), Hernando, Inting, and Delos Santos, JJ., concur.","label":[[17,32,"CASE_NUM"],[34,48,"PROM_DATE"],[51,67,"PERSON"],[93,109,"PERSON"],[113,126,"PERSON"],[157,162,"PERSON"],[329,345,"INS"],[347,349,"INS"],[361,374,"CASE_NUM"],[458,478,"INS"],[480,483,"INS"],[524,540,"CASE_NUM"],[551,553,"INS"],[1013,1021,"PERSON"],[1026,1039,"PERSON"],[1328,1341,"PERSON"],[2010,2025,"PERSON"],[2043,2056,"PERSON"],[3669,3673,"INS"],[4254,4270,"INS"],[4294,4296,"INS"],[4951,4953,"INS"],[4973,4990,"STA"],[5469,5486,"STA"],[5563,5565,"INS"],[5945,5947,"INS"],[6096,6099,"INS"],[6236,6238,"INS"],[6556,6576,"INS"],[6616,6632,"CASE_NUM"],[7157,7164,"STA"],[7188,7190,"INS"],[7369,7371,"INS"],[8117,8134,"INS"],[8320,8336,"INS"],[8494,8501,"STA"],[8694,8710,"INS"],[8716,8729,"INS"],[8735,8755,"INS"],[11734,11741,"STA"],[11785,11798,"INS"],[11894,11901,"STA"],[12185,12192,"STA"],[12377,12384,"STA"],[12790,12806,"INS"],[12966,12982,"INS"],[13305,13321,"INS"],[13747,13753,"PERSON"],[13928,13936,"PERSON"],[14058,14064,"PERSON"],[14931,14933,"INS"],[15923,15925,"INS"],[19001,19015,"INS"],[19128,19147,"STA"],[19247,19266,"STA"],[20506,20522,"INS"],[22006,22018,"STA"],[22043,22052,"STA"],[22476,22488,"STA"],[22879,22881,"INS"],[23893,23923,"INS"],[24176,24179,"INS"],[24242,24245,"INS"],[25034,25046,"STA"],[25597,25610,"CASE_NUM"],[25736,25744,"PERSON"],[25749,25762,"PERSON"],[25775,25788,"PERSON"],[25823,25831,"PERSON"],[25836,25849,"PERSON"],[26098,26104,"PERSON"],[26120,26128,"PERSON"],[26130,26136,"PERSON"],[26142,26154,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

SECURITY TRADING CORPORATION, NONPAREIL INTERNATIONAL FREIGHT AND CARGO SERVICES, INC., FAR EASTERN KNITTING CORPORATION, JOSE CHING, AND ESPERANZA CHING, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nPERLAS-BERNABE, J.:\nAssailed in the instant petition for review on certiorari are the Decision dated December 2, 2016 and the Resolution dated April 10, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 143770, which affirmed the Decision dated September 29, 2015 and the Resolution dated October 30, 2015 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in LAC No. 07-001948-15 finding petitioner Remegio E. Burnea (petitioner) not entitled to his money claims.\nThe Facts\nPetitioner claimed that in February 2005, respondents-spouses Jose T. Ching and Esperanza R. Ching (spouses Ching) hired him as a construction worker for their company, respondent Security Trading Corporation (STC), a domestic corporation engaged in the business of construction, equipment, materials, and supplies. Upon completion of STC's construction project, petitioner was hired as stay-in security guard of STC's premises with a monthly salary of P8,500.. On March 1, 2010, he was transferred to respondent Far Eastern Knitting Corporation (Far Eastern), a company also owned by spouses Ching, to protect and secure the said company's property. Because of the trust reposed upon him by spouses Ching, petitioner was issued an Authority to Sell the Far Eastern's property that he was guarding. On November 15, 2013, Far Eastern's property was eventually sold to respondent Nonpareil International Freight & Cargo Services, Inc. (Nonpareil). After he was paid his commission, petitioner was no longer paid his salary for the period of November 1-15, 2013 and was purportedly told by Far Eastern's management that his services were no longer needed and to just go back to his province.\nAggrieved with the foregoing developments, petitioner initially filed on September 25, 2014 a complaint against Far Eastern via Single-Entry Approach (SENA) before the Regional Conciliation and Mediation Board  NCR for money claims, non-payment\/underpayment of wages, non-payment of overtime pay, night shift differential pay, service incentive leave, holiday pay, SSS, Pag-Ibig, Phil Health, unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal, separation pay, and payment of labor standard law benefits (SENA Complaint). The SENA Complaint was, however, deemed closed and terminated due to petitioner's filing of a similar complaint before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) against respondents STC, Nonpareil, Far Eastern, and spouses Ching for underpayment of salary\/wages and 13th month pay, and non-payment of overtime pay, holiday pay, holiday premium, rest day premium, service incentive leave, separation pay, ECOLA, and night shift differential, docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 11-13578-14 (NLRC Complaint). Notably, while petitioner included the payment of separation pay in the causes of action in the NLRC complaint, he failed to include a cause of action for illegal dismissal. Nonetheless, a reading of petitioner's Position Paper would show that he specifically argued that he was illegally dismissed, and hence, entitled to, among others, separation pay.\nThe NLRC Complaint was dropped as against spouses Ching on the ground of lack of jurisdiction due to failure to serve summons on them, while STC was deemed to have waived its right to be heard for failure to appear at the mandatory conferences despite receipt of summons. Similarly, records are bereft of showing that Far Eastern filed any position paper or participated in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter (LA).\nFor its part, Nonpareil denied having any business relationship with Far Eastern asserting that it is a separate and distinct entity and that its only association with the latter was the purchase of its property. It likewise denied any employer-employee relationship with petitioner, claiming that the latter was never in its payroll and that there was no agreement to absorb him as its employee after the sale.\nThe LA Ruling\nIn a Decision dated March 27, 2015, the LA partially ruled in favor of petitioner, ordering STC to pay him salary differentials, holiday pay, and service incentive leave pay, subject to the three (3)-year prescriptive period, to be reckoned from November 3, 2011 up to the date of his dismissal on November 17, 2013 as alleged in the complaint, or in the aggregate amount of P75,576.. All other claims were, however, dismissed for lack of merit and\/or lack of jurisdiction.\nAt the outset, the LA found Nonpareil as an entity separate and distinct from STC and Far Eastern, and hence, not liable to pay petitioner's claims, considering that it only bought the property where Far Eastern used to hold office. Relatedly, the LA declared STC as the true employer of petitioner as it was STC that paid his salaries\/wages as shown by the payslips and that he was merely transferred to Far Eastern with the approval of STC's President, Jose T. Ching.\nWith respect to petitioner's money claims, the LA held that petitioner is entitled to salary differentials, holiday pay, and service incentive leave pay, subject, however, to the three (3)-year prescriptive period provided by law, as STC failed to show that it correctly paid the same to petitioner. However, the LA denied petitioner's claims for 13th month pay, night shift differentials, overtime pay, holiday premium, and rest day premium for his failure to either discuss or provide proof of his entitlement thereto in his position paper. Similarly, the LA rejected petitioner's claims for SSS, Pag-Ibig, and Phil Health contributions for lack of jurisdiction. Furthermore, the LA rejected petitioner's claim for separation pay, pointing out that separation pay is only granted in cases of illegal dismissal, and that illegal dismissal is not among the causes of action listed in petitioner's complaint before the NLRC. In ruling for such rejection, the LA cited Section 12 (c) of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure (2011 NLRC Rules), which provides that the parties' position paper shall only cover claims and causes of action stated in the complaint or amended complaint. Finally, petitioner's claims for damages and attorney's fees were likewise rejected on the same ground.\nDissatisfied, petitioner appealed to the NLRC, asserting his entitlement to all his money claims as no payments were shown to have been made by his employer, and that his claim for illegal dismissal was uncontested. As such, he insists on his entitlement to, inter alia, full backwages, separation pay, damages, and attorney's fees in accordance with law.\nThe NLRC Ruling\nIn a Decision dated September 29, 2015, the NLRC affirmed the LA Decision, holding that the alleged underpayment of 13th month pay and night shift differentials were not specifically claimed in petitioner's position paper, while ,the non-payment of overtime, holiday premium, and rest day were not substantiated. It likewise sustained the denial of separation pay, damages, and attorney's fees, ruling that the complaint, despite having been amended three (3) times, neither included a claim for illegal dismissal nor other claims as causes of action. Lastly, it did not give merit to the belated submission of cash vouchers to prove non-payment of petitioner's money claims as the same only showed the fact of underpayment, and that the failure to prove payment of the other money claims did not necessarily result in its outright grant pointing out that the claimant must prove his entitlement thereto.\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration which was denied in a Resolution dated October 30, 2015. Hence, the matter was elevated to the CA via a petition for certiorari , docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 143770.\nThe CA Ruling\nIn a Decision dated December 2, 2016, the CA affirmed the NLRC ruling. ℒαwρhi৷ The CA ruled that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in not passing upon the issues of illegal dismissal and petitioner's entitlement to separation pay, damages, and attorney's fees in connection therewith as the same were not raised in his complaint. It also sustained the denial of petitioner's 13th month pay, overtime pay, holiday premium, rest day premium, and night shift differential for failure to prove his entitlement thereto. On the other hand, it found the LA correct in awarding salary differentials as well as holiday pay and service incentive leave but only for the period from November 3, 2011 up to November 17, 2013. It likewise agreed that respondents Nonpareil and Far Eastern were two separate entities, absent any evidence linking the two corporations.\nPetitioner's motion for reconsideration was likewise denied in a Resolution dated April 10, 2017; hence, this petition.\nThe Issue Before the Court\nThe issue before the Court is whether or not the CA correctly ruled that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in: (a) denying petitioner's money claims for 13th month pay, overtime pay, holiday premium, rest day premium, and night shift differential; and (b) not ruling on the issue of illegal dismissal and consequently, denying petitioner's entitlement to money claims in connection therewith since the same was not raised in his complaint.\nThe Court's Ruling\nThe petition is denied.\nAnent petitioner's money claims for 13th month pay, overtime pay, holiday premium, rest day premium, and night shift differential, suffice it to say that the labor tribunals and the CA correctly found that he was unable to prove his entitlement thereto, essentially on the ground that he failed to properly allege by how much he was being underpaid and for what period. Absent any of the recognized exceptions, factual findings of the labor tribunals, as affirmed by the CA, are binding on the Court, as in this case.\nWith respect to the issues on illegal dismissal and the money claims concomitant thereto, such as separation pay, damages, and attorney's fees, the labor tribunals and the CA refused to resolve the same on pure technicality. Particularly, they ruled that since these money claims arise from a finding of illegal dismissal and the latter was not among the causes of action listed in petitioner's NLRC Complaint, they are precluded from passing on the issue of illegal dismissal, pursuant to Section 12, Rule V of the 2011 NLRC Rules. This provision, which governs the rules on submission of position papers and replies before the NLRC, reads:\nSECTION 12. SUBMISSION OF POSITION PAPER AND REPLY. \n(a) Subject to Sections 9 and 10 of this Rule, the Labor Arbiter shall direct the parties to submit simultaneously their verified position papers with supporting documents and affidavits, if any, on a date set by him\/her within ten (10) calendar days from the date of termination of the mandatory conciliation and mediation conference.\n(b) No amendment of the complaint or petition shall be allowed after the filing of the position papers, unless with leave of the Labor Arbiter.\n(c) The position papers of the parties shall cover only those claims and causes of action stated in the complaint or amended complaint, accompanied by all supporting documents, including the affidavits of witnesses, which shall take the place of their direct testimony, excluding those that may have been amicably settled.\n(d) Within ten (10) days from receipt of the position paper of the adverse party, a reply may be filed on a date agreed upon and during schedule set before the Labor Arbiter. The reply shall not allege and\/or prove facts and any causes of action not referred to or included in the original or amended complaint or petition or raised in the position paper. (Emphases supplied)\nSub-paragraph (c) purportedly limits the coverage of the position papers of the parties to only those claims and causes of action stated in the complaint or amended complaint; whereas sub-paragraph (d) directs that the reply shall only allege and prove facts and causes of action contained in the original or amended complaint or in the position paper. At this juncture, it is well to take judicial notice of the fact that initiatory complaints filed before the NLRC are just blank forms wherein the employee-complainant simply inputs his\/her details, the respondent's details, and ticks off a checklist of causes of action which are applicable to him\/her. It is only upon the filing of position papers that the complainant is able to expound on the employer's acts or omissions which constitute his\/her causes of action against the latter. Given the foregoing, it is only reasonable to infer that notwithstanding the aforementioned provision, the complaint cannot be the sole basis in determining the complainant's causes of action given that it is in the position paper that the ultimate facts are presented and established by the submission of all relevant documents and affidavits to support the same and prove their respective causes of action. Otherwise stated, the filing of the position paper, and not the mere complaint, is the operative act that should foreclose the raising of matters constitutive of the employee-complainant's cause of action. The Court believes that it is for this reason why sub-paragraph (d) of Section 12, Rule V of the 2011 NLRC Rules allows the replies to discuss matters not only covered by the complaint or amended complaint, but also those covered by the position papers. Furthermore, this interpretation is in accord with the settled norm that \"[i]n labor cases, rules of procedure should not be applied in a very rigid and technical sense,\" and that \"labor officials should use all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, in the interest of due process.\"\nIn this case, records show that petitioner initially filed a SENA Complaint which includes, illegal dismissal and the concomitant claim of separation pay as his causes of action. Petitioner's SENA Complaint was, however, deemed closed and terminated when he filed his NLRC Complaint  which, while including separation pay as among the causes of action indicated therein, did not include illegal dismissal. Nonetheless, petitioner went ahead and presented arguments supporting his claim for illegal dismissal in his position paper. Verily, these circumstances raise doubts as to whether petitioner indeed intended to remove his cause of action for illegal dismissal when he essentially refiled his SENA Complaint as his NLRC Complaint. In view of the foregoing, and in the interest of substantial justice, the Court hereby resolves the issue of whether or not petitioner has been illegally dismissed from employment, and hence, entitled to, among others, separation pay.\nIn cases of illegal dismissal, the employer bears the burden of proof to prove that the termination was for a valid or authorized cause. However, it is well to clarify that before the employer bears such burden, it is imperative for the employee to first establish by substantial evidence that he\/she was indeed dismissed from employment. Absent such dismissal, there could be no question as to its legality or illegality.\nHere, other than petitioner's self-serving allegation that he was terminated from work and told to go back to his province, no evidence was presented to establish the same. In fact, petitioner failed to identify the person from Far Eastern who purportedly terminated his services. It bears stressing that a party alleging a critical fact must support his allegation with substantial evidence, for any decision based on unsubstantiated allegation cannot stand without offending due process, which petitioner failed to discharge. Moreover, since he was merely transferred by STC to guard Far Eastern's property, its sale to Nonpareil should have prompted petitioner to return to STC, his original employer, which he failed to show. When there is a claim of dismissal, much more illegal, the fact of dismissal must be established by positive and overt acts of an employer indicating the intention to dismiss before the burden is shifted to the employer to prove that the dismissal was legal. Evidently, absent substantial proof, or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion that he was dismissed or prevented from reporting for work by respondents, petitioner's claim of illegal dismissal cannot stand.\nConsequently, having ruled out the claim of illegal dismissal, and the issue of separation pay arising as a consequence thereof, petitioner's claim for payment of the same must necessarily be denied. In the same vein, there is likewise no legal basis to award damages to petitioner absent any showing of malice or bad faith on the part of respondents.\nNonetheless, since petitioner was awarded salary differentials, holiday pay, and service incentive leave pay, subject to the three (3)-year prescriptive period, to be reckoned from November 3, 2011 up to the date of his dismissal on November 17, 2013 as alleged in the complaint, he is also entitled to attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award in accordance with Article 111 of the Labor Code and Article 2208 of the Civil Code, as the latter was clearly compelled to litigate to protect his rights and interests thereto. Finally, in line with prevailing jurisprudence, all monetary awards due to petitioner shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid.\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED . The assailed Decision dated December 2, 2016 and the Resolution dated April 10, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 143770 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION S, awarding to petitioner Remegio E. Burnea attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the monetary awards due to him, and imposing on all monetary awards legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of the Decision until fully paid.\nSO ORDERED.\nLazaro-Javier, M.

{"id":936,"text":"THIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 202661, March 17, 2021 ]\nLETICIA A. RAMIREZ, PETITIONER, VS. FELOMINO ELOMINA, REPRESENTED BY HIS ATTORNEY-IN­FACT, FEDERICO ELOMINA,*, RESPONDENT.**\nDECISION\nHERNANDO, J.:\nChallenged in this appeal is the Court of Appeals' May 25, 2012 Resolution ordering the issuance of an Entry of Judgment of its October 12, 2011 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 92374 which declared respondent Felomino Elomina (Felomino) as the lawful owner of the subject property and ordered petitioner Leticia Ramirez (Ramirez) to reconvey said property to Felomino. The May 25, 2012 Resolution was issued in relation to the appellate court's December 21, 2011 Resolution which denied Ramirez's Motion for Reconsideration for having been filed out of time.\nThe Antecedent Facts:\nOn May 11, 1994, Ramirez was issued an Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-4884 pursuant to Free Patent No. 043404-94-1330 granted on May 2, 1994 over Lot No. 922, Cad-455-D located at Butong, Cabuyao, Laguna, with an area of 1,087 square meters.\nOn July 11, 2000, Felomino filed a letter-protest with the Bureau of Lands of Los Baños, Laguna against the approval of the application and issuance of the free patent to Ramirez. Felomino claimed that the patent application was allegedly transferred to Ramirez by one Delfin Torinos (Torinos). Both Ramirez and Torinos were never in possession of the subject land. Felomino asserted that he was in possession of the subject land in the concept of an owner since birth.\nConsequently, the City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) Regional Executive Director of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) issued an order directing the CENRO to conduct an investigation. On December 29, 2003, the Regional Executive Director issued an order cancelling and revoking the free patent of Ramirez. The DENR Legal Division was also directed to initiate proceedings leading to the cancellation of Ramirez's OCT No. P-4884 and the reversion of the subject land to the public domain.\nThe DENR pointed out that, upon ocular inspection, it was found that the members of the Elomina family were in possession of the property, and that there was nothing to show that the Ramirezes or their predecessor-in­interest, Torinos, had ever occupied the subject property. Thus, Ramirez's application for free patent was found as having been tainted with misrepresentations constituting fraud and rendered void the application and free patent itself.\nOn December 12, 2005, Felomino, represented by his attorney-in-fact, Federico Elomina (Federico), sued for reconveyance of title and damages before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Biñan, Laguna, against Ramirez and the Registry of Deeds of Calamba City, Laguna. In an amended complaint, Felomino alleged that: (i) he is the actual possessor and occupant of the subject land; (ii) the property was first occupied and possessed by his father, Felix Elomina, since time immemorial; (iii) they were surprised when they were informed that on May 11, 1994, Ramirez was able to secure an OCT over the land pursuant to a free patent which the DENR subsequently cancelled and revoked; (iv) he was unlawfully deprived of a legitimate right and peaceful possession over the land when Ramirez was issued an OCT; and (v) he is entitled under the law to recover the subject property which was erroneously registered in the name of Ramirez.\nFelomino prayed that he be declared the lawful owner of the subject property. He also asked for compensation of damages and that Ramirez be ordered to reconvey the subject land to him and for the Register of Deeds to cancel Ramirez's OCT No. P-4884 and issue a new Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) under his name.\nRamirez filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of forum-shopping considering that there was also a pending case between the parties before the Supreme Court involving the same issues. However, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss.\nIn her Answer, Ramirez interposed the following affirmative defenses - that the action is barred by prescription, the complaint states no cause of action and Felomino is not the real party-in-interest.\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court:\nIn its March 13, 2008 Decision, the trial court dismissed Felomino's complaint for lack of merit.\nThe trial court pointed out that Felomino had no cause of action since he failed to sufficiently prove his title to support his claim of ownership over the disputed property. At the time that OCT No. 4884 was issued to Ramirez in 1994, Felomino had not filed any application for patent on the land in question.\nAssuming arguendo that Ramirez committed misrepresentation in her patent application, Felomino was not the real party-in-interest to file the case. The trial court pointed out that the DENR recommended the State to file reversion proceedings. Thus, since the subject property originated from a grant by the State, the cancellation of the issued patent was between the grantor and the grantee.\nLastly, the RTC ruled that the cause of action had already prescribed. Ramirez's OCT was issued in May 1994 while Felomino filed the action more than 10 years later or in December 2005. The trial court held that an action for reconveyance resulting from fraud prescribes in four years from discovery, which was deemed to have taken place when the property was registered in 1994.\nThe dispositive portion of the trial court's Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the instant case is ordered DISMISSED for lack of merit.\nSO ORDERED.\nFelomino moved for reconsideration. Pending its resolution, the DENR, through its Regional Executive Director, received a letter from the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in response to his request for the filing of a complaint for cancellation of title against Ramirez. The OSG wrote:\nA cause of action for declaration of nullity of free patent and certificate of title would require allegations of the plaintiff's ownership of the contested lot prior to the issuance of such free patent and certificate of title as well as the defendant's fraud or mistake, as the case may be, in successfully obtaining these documents of title over the parcel of land claimed by plaintiff. In such a case, the nullity arises strictly not from the fraud or deceit but from the fact that the land is beyond the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Lands to bestow and whatever patent or certificate of title obtained therefore is consequently void ab initio. The real party in interest is not the State but the plaintiff who alleges a pre-existing right of ownership over the parcel of land in question even before the grant of title to the defendant. Accordingly, it is Felomino Elomina, the intended beneficiary over the parcel of land in question, who should file the complaint for cancellation of free patent and certificate of title since he is the real party-in-interest.\nIn its November 14, 2008 Order, the trial court denied Felomino's Motion for Reconsideration. The trial court reiterated that the action has already prescribed and that he is not the real party in interest, since he is neither an applicant nor a registered owner of the Subject Land.\nRuling of the Court of Appeals:\nOn appeal, Felomino maintained that he is the real party in interest and that his cause of action has not yet prescribed. He asserted that an action for reconveyance of title based on fraud is imprescriptible where the holder of the title has never been in possession and the land is possessed by the adverse party in the concept of an owner.\nIn its October 12, 2011 Decision, the appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court. 1aшphi1 The relevant portion of the appellate court's Decision reads:\nFrom the testimony of the plaintiff-appellant's son, Federico, it appears that their family had been living on Lot 922 dating back to the time of his grandfather Felix. In the time of Felomino alone, more than 70 years had passed. His father and he are still living on the lot, and during all this time, they did not know of anybody claiming right over the lot. Despite their continuous possession of the land, however, they could not show any document to show their ownership, as his father and grandfather were ignorant and did not know how to have the land titled in their names. Then in 1994, the defendant Ramirez surfaced and tried to evict them from the property, although she did not have any house on and was not in possession of the land. They filed a protest against the defendant with the DENR in July 2000, some 6 years later, because of lack of knowledge of his parents.\nFernando Velandres, the Chief of the Legal Division of the Regional Office [of the DENR], had gone to the area and confirmed the presence of more than ten houses where the family of Elomina were residing. There was nothing to indicate that the defendant had any house there.\nThere is no question that [the]land occupied by the plantiff-appellant [Felomino] and his family is within the alienable portion of the public domain, or the DENR would not have agreed to issue a patent to the defendant-appellee [Ramirez]. It is also uncontested that they have been in possession for more than 70 years, practically since time immemorial, since the possession dates back to the time of his father. And it is as plain as day that the plaintiff-­appellant is in present possession as confirmed by the DENR officials who made a personal inspection of the land. The defendant-appellee had never possessed the land, and she was able to obtain a patent only through the misrepresentation that she was the occupant. She was able to obtain registration through fraud on the rights of the rightful occupants who are the plaintiff-­appellant and his family.\nx x x x\nIn this case, the plaintiff-appellant, not counting the possession of his father, had lived on the property all his life, and he is now over 70 years old.\nPrescinding from the fact that, by virtue of their possession, adverse and uninterrupted for more than the required period, the lot in question[,] Lot 922[,] has become private property and passed to their ownership through a presumed grant from the government, the plaintiff-appellant has absolutely the right to file an action for reconveyance to recover the title from the defendant-appellee who recorded it in her name without their knowledge through registration proceedings.\nThe appellate court further pointed out that the four-year prescriptive period as to an action for reconveyance of real property resulting from fraud does not apply where the party applying for reconveyance is in possession of the property.\nThe dispositive portion of the appellate court's Decision reads:\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision appealed from is reversed. The plaintiff-appellant Felomino Elomin[a] is declared the lawful owner of Lot 922 erroneously covered by OCT No. P-4884 in the name of the defendant-appellee Leticia Ramirez. The defendant-appellant is ordered to reconvey the property to the plaintiff-appellant, and the Register of Deeds of Calamba, Laguna to cancel the defendant-appellee's OCT No. P4884 and issue a new TCT to the plaintiff-appellant Felomino Elomina.\nSO ORDERED.\nRamirez received a copy of the foregoing Decision on October 17, 2011. After 17 days from receipt thereof, or on November 3, 2011, she filed a Motion for Reconsideration.\nIn a December 21, 2011 Resolution, the appellate court denied said Motion for late filing and therefore the appellate court's jurisdiction to act on it had been lost. Thus, in its May 25, 2012 Resolution, the appellate court ordered the issuance of an Entry of Judgment in CA-G.R. CV No. 92374. The court noted that on January 19, 2012, its October 12, 2011 Decision had become final and executory.\nUndaunted, Ramirez filed the instant Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with prayer for the issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and\/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction.\nIssue\nThe instant Petition raised the lone assignment of error of whether or not the appellate court committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying Ramirez's Motion for Reconsideration for having been filed belatedly and thereafter issuing an order for the issuance of an entry of judgment to the alleged undue prejudice of petitioner.\nOur Ruling\nWe resolve to dismiss the instant Petition.\nRamirez admits having committed the procedural infraction but asks for the relaxation of the rules. She explains that the inadvertent late filing of the November 3, 2011 Motion for Reconsideration with the appellate court was due to forgetfulness in view of her old age and frail condition.\nThe Court is not persuaded.\nSection 1, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court provides for the period to file a Motion for Reconsideration:\nSection 1. Period of filing. - A party may file a motion for reconsideration of a judgment or final resolution within fifteen (15) days from notice thereof, with proof of service on the adverse party. (Emphasis supplied)\nRule 36, Section 2 of the same Rules also provides that a judgment or final order shall become final unless a Motion for Reconsideration is timely filed, to wit:\nSection 2. Entry of Judgments and Final Orders. - If no appeal or motion for new trial or reconsideration is filed within the time provided in these Rules, the judgment or final order shall forthwith be entered by the clerk in the book of entries of judgments. The date of finality of the judgment or final order shall be deemed to be the date of its entry. The record shall contain the dispositive part of the judgment or final order and shall be signed by the clerk, with a certificate that such judgment or final order has become final and executory. (Emphasis supplied)\nIn the instant case, the following are the relevant dates: (i) On October 12, 2011 the appellate court issued its Decision; (ii) Ramirez received a copy of the appellate court's Decision on October 17, 2011; (iii) After 17 days from receipt thereof, or on November 3, 2011, she filed a Motion for Reconsideration; (iv) On December 21, 2011, the appellate court issued its Resolution denying the Motion since it was belatedly filed; and (v) On May 25, 2012, the appellate court issued a Resolution directing the issuance of an entry of judgment in CA-G.R. CV No. 92374.\nThe 15th day of the allowable period for Ramirez to file her Motion for Reconsideration fell on a holiday, November 1, 2011. Thus, Ramirez had until November 2, 2011 to file the same, reckoned from the date of her receipt of the appellate court's Decision. However, she filed the Motion the following day, or November 3, 2011. She explained that:\nx x x x [She] entrusted the filing thereof to her son [Herdy Ramirez] who stayed at Antipolo City while she lived in Marikina City.\nAnd because of [Leticia Ramirez's] old age and forgetfulness, the said decision was handed over by her to Herdy only on October 27, 2011 or five days prior to its expiration to file a Motion for Reconsideration.\nx x x x\nHerdy had to look for a lawyer during those times that can render services to them .... in submitting the Motion for Reconsideration before the deadline - November 2, 2011[,] in lieu of November 1, 2011 because the latter date is an official holiday.\nx x x x\nNonetheless, the said Motion for Reconsideration was finished exactly on the deadline period (November 2, 2012).\nx x x x\nYet, despite the copies of the said Motion for Reconsideration being timely sent by registered mail on November 2, 2011 by Herdy himself at the Marikina Post Office to the addresses and parties in said case, Herdy who travelled immediately to the Court of Appeals to personally file the said Motion for Reconsideration (MR) arrived therein before the closing hours that afternoon but was not immediately accommodated because he was required by the Court of Appeals personnel to photocopy certain requirements for the filing of the subject Motion.\nBut after finishing all the photocopies of the required documents at the Court of Appeals during that afternoon, the office where the motion is to be filed had already closed business transactions for that day, nonetheless, a court personnel advised Herdy to file the said Motion on the next day (November 3, 2011).\nx x x x\nBelieving in good faith that the Motion for Reconsideration can still be filed on the next day (November 3, 2012), Herdy immediately filed the said Motion on November 3, 2012.\nTime and again, the Court has declared that \"the right to appeal is neither a natural right nor a part of due process. It is merely a statutory privilege and may be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of law. Thus, one who seeks to avail of the right to appeal must comply with the requirements of the Rules. Failure to do so .... leads to the loss of the right to appeal\" , such as the instant case.\nThis Court finds no compelling reason to justify the relaxation of the rules. Settled is the rule that \"[a]nyone seeking exemption from the application of the reglementary period for filing an appeal has the burden of proving the existence of exceptionally meritorious instances warranting such deviation\". However, this Court finds that Ramirez failed to discharge the same, thus warranting the appellate court's denial of her Motion for Reconsideration.\nWe are not unaware that the technical rules of procedure should be used to promote, not frustrate, the cause of justice. However, this liberality in the relaxation of the rules should be carefully weighed against the orderly administration of justice. Procedural rules are not to be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may result in prejudice to a party's substantive rights. Like all rules, they are required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons when they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed.\nAs aptly discussed by this Court in St. Louis University, Inc. v. Olairez, observance is the rule and non-observance is the exception, to wit:\nIt should be emphasized that procedural rules are tools designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases. Courts and litigants alike are, thus, enjoined to abide strictly by the rules. Although the Court, in some cases, permits a relaxation in the application of the rules, this was never intended to forge a bastion for erring litigants to violate the rules with impunity. It is true that litigation is not a game of technicalities, but it is equally true that every case must be prosecuted in accordance with the prescribed procedure to insure an orderly and speedy administration of justice.\nThe instant case is no exception to the foregoing rule. Thus, due to Ramirez's disregard of the Rules, the appellate court was justified in denying her motion.\nThis Court further notes that the instant Petition challenges the appellate court's May 25, 2012 Resolution which ordered the issuance of an Entry of Judgment. LaW㏗iL However, said Resolution was a necessary consequence of the appellate court's December 21, 2011 Resolution which denied the November 3, 2011 Motion for Reconsideration due to late filing.\nThus, the appropriate recourse would have been for Ramirez to timely file an appeal of the December 21, 2011 Resolution, which she received on January 5, 2012. She had until January 20, 2012 to file an appeal, reckoned from the date of her receipt. However, the instant Petition was only filed on August 10, 2012, and thus likewise filed beyond the reglementary period to file an appeal.\nIn view of the foregoing, We find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the appellate court. A special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is designed to correct errors of jurisdiction and not errors in judgment. Thus, We have repeatedly held that when \"the court has jurisdiction over the case and person of the defendant, any mistake in the application of the law and the appreciation of evidence committed by a court may be corrected only by appeal.\"\nIn the instant case, it is undisputed that the CA had jurisdiction over the case. What Ramirez actually seeks is the reversal of the appellate courts' ruling declaring Felomino as the lawful owner of the subject land. Therefore, assuming there was any error in the appellate court's interpretation of the law and appreciation of evidence, it may only be corrected through an appeal and not through certiorari , since it is considered as an error of judgment and not of jurisdiction.\nMoreover, a special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court can only strike down an act that was done with grave abuse of discretion. Settled is the rule that \"[f]or certiorari to prosper, the abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility\"\nIn Aujero v. Philippine Communciations Satelline Corp., this Court emphasized that \"[n]ot every error in a proceeding, or every erroneous conclusion of law or fact, is an act in excess of jurisdiction or an abuse of discretion. The prerogative writ of certiorari does not lie except to correct, not every misstep, but a grave abuse of discretion.\"\nIn view of the belated filing of Ramirez's Motion, the appellate court's Decision had become final and executory. Basic is the rule that once a judgment had attained finality, it can no longer be disturbed, altered or modified, the controversy is settled and the matter is laid to rest. In Gatmaytan v. Sps. Dolor We pronounced:\n[A] [final judgment] may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land.\nOnce a judgment becomes final, the court or tribunal loses jurisdiction, and any modified judgment that it issues, as well as all proceedings taken for this purpose are null and void.\nWHEREFORE , the instant Petition is hereby DISMISSED . The assailed Court of Appeals' May 25, 2012 Resolution which ordered the issuance of an Entry of Judgment of its October 12, 2011 Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 92374 is hereby AFFIRMED . No pronouncement as to costs.\nSO ORDERED.\nLeonen, (Chairperson), Inting, Delos Santos, and J.

{"id":937,"text":"THIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 249168, April 26, 2021 ]\nAILEEN CYNTHIA M. AMURAO, PETITIONER, V. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND SANDIGANBAYAN SIXTH DIVISION, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nLOPEZ, J., J.:\nThe Verified Petition for Certiorari , Prohibition, and Mandamus (with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction) filed by petitioner Aileen Cynthia M. Amurao seeks the nullification and setting aside of the Resolution dated September 5, 2019 issued by the respondent Sandiganbayan Sixth Division, ordering the suspension pendente lite of petitioner in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-1385.\nThe case stemmed from an Affidavit executed by Doris Suelo, Sheryl Lynn Lebante, and Engilbert Alvarez, the private complainants in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-1385, wherein they alleged that petitioner and her co-accused, as tourism officers of the City Government of Puerto Princesa, Palawan, solicited money and other gifts from private individuals and entities for the purpose of tourism activities. The money and gifts solicited then went to the personal and individual accounts of the petitioner and her co-accused.\nIn an Information dated March 5, 2015, petitioner and several others were charged before the Sandiganbayan with violation of Section 7(d) of Republic Act No. (R.A.) 6713, otherwise known as the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees. The Information states:\nThat on or about the period between February 2014 and April 2014 or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused public officers, Aileen Cynthia M. Amurao, being the City Tourism Officer and Head of the City Tourism Department, Joyce C. Enriquez, Tourism Operations Assistant, Michie H. Meneses, Tourism Operations Officer I, and Michael Angelo M. Meneses and Lucero Aquino, Jr., contractual Tourism Operations Assistant, all of the City Tourism Department, City Government of Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, while in the performance of their functions, taking advantage of their positions, committing the offense in relation to their office, and conspiring and confederating with each other, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and criminally solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or anything of monetary value from tourism-oriented and private entities or individuals by sending them solicitation letters for sponsorship of the City Government of Puerto Princesa's tourism activities and related projects, supervised by the accused.\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\nDuring the pendency of the proceedings, the Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution dated July 23, 2019 pursuant to Section 4, Rule VIII of the 2018 Revised Internal Rules of the Sandiganbayan. ℒαwρhi৷ The Order directed petitioner to show cause why she should not be suspended pendente lite in accordance with Section 13 of R.A. 3019.\nIn her Compliance and Manifestation, petitioner claimed that she should not be suspended because Section 13 of R.A. 3019 only applies to those charged with violation under the same law and the provisions under the Revised Penal Code (RPC) on bribery, and not to violations of R.A. 6713 of which she was charged.\nOn September 5, 2019, the Sandiganbayan issued the assailed Resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, accused AILEEN CYNTHIA MAGGAY AMURAO is ordered SUSPENDED pendente lite, for a period of ninety (90) days, as Head of the Office of the City Tourism of Puerto Princesa City, or any other public position she may now or hereafter be holding.\nAccused Aileen Cynthia Maggay Amurao is ordered to CEASE AND DESIST from further performing and\/or exercising the functions, duties, and privileges of her position upon the implementation of this Order of Preventive Suspension. The suspension of the accused shall be automatically lifted upon the expiration of the 90-day period from the implementation of this resolution.\nThe Sandiganbayan ruled that the offense charged against petitioner is covered by the rule on preventive suspension under Section 13 of R.A. 3019. It noted that the imposition of preventive suspension is applicable not only to those charged with violation of R.A. 3019 and Title 7, Book II of the RPC, but also to those charged with any offense involving fraud upon the government and any offense involving public funds or property. Finding that the latter two instances applies to petitioner's case, the Sandiganbayan held that fraud upon the government was committed when the money received from solicitations was deposited in petitioner's personal bank account and allegedly used for the latter's personal consumption; and that such amounts of money solicited from the private individuals and entities are public funds as they were intended for the tourism activities of the City Government of Puerto Princesa.\nPetitioner did not move for the reconsideration of the assailed Resolution. Instead, she filed the instant petition, imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Sandiganbayan.\nThe contentions raised by petitioner boil down to the lone issue of whether the Sandiganbayan, Sixth Division committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it issued the assailed Resolution ordering her suspension pendente lite.\nPetitioner maintains that violation of Section 7(d) of R.A. 6713 is not among those offenses covered by the preventive suspension rule under Section 13 of R.A. 3019 as there is yet to be a categorical pronouncement on such inclusion. She asserts that the letters which became the basis of her indictment refer to the term \"sponsorship\" and not solicitation. Petitioner likewise argues that she did not commit fraud and that deceit was not proven in relation to the offense charged against her. She claims that evidence for the defense in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-1385 would show that the cash, gift checks, and other form of awards went directly to the participants and winners of contests, pageants, and other activities. Petitioner also contends that the money that came from tourism stakeholders was not in the nature of public funds because it was still in the possession of the one in charge or assigned to collect and keep the same for distribution during an awards night.\nIn its Comment, the People of the Philippines, represented by the Office of the Ombudsman, through the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), argues that Section 7(d) of R.A. 6713 is included among the offenses covered by Section 13 of R.A. No. 3019. It maintains that the assailed Resolution was issued on the basis of compliance with Section 13, R.A. 3019, as amended, reiterating that the fraudulent act of petitioner was established through evidence before the Sandiganbayan when money (and gifts) was solicited from private individuals and deposited in petitioner's (and her co-accused's) personal accounts. The OSP likewise echoes the ruling of the Sandiganbayan that the sums of money subject of the criminal case, having been collected for the purpose of tourism activities, are public funds.\nThe Ruling of the Court\nWe first discuss the procedural issue of petitioner's failure to file a motion for reconsideration prior to resorting to the present petition for certiorari , prohibition, and mandamus.\nIn her Verified Petition, petitioner submits that she did not file a motion for reconsideration because the preventive suspension contemplated in Section 13 of R.A. 3019 is mandatory and ministerial on the part of the Sandiganbayan. ℒαwρhi৷ She, likewise, posits that the instant petition falls under the exceptions to the necessity of filing a motion for reconsideration.\nIt has long been settled that a motion for reconsideration is a condition sine qua non for the filing of a petition for certiorari . The objective of this mandate is to allow the lower court, or tribunal, the opportunity to correct any actual or perceived error imputed to it.\nIn Siok Ping Tan v. Subic Bay Distribution, Inc., however, the Court reiterated that the foregoing rule admits of exceptions:\nx x x The rule is, however, circumscribed by well-defined exceptions, such as (a) where the order is a patent nullity, as where the court a quo had no jurisdiction; (b) where the questions raised in the certiorari proceeding have been duly raised and passed upon by the lower court, or are the same as those raised and passed upon in the lower court; (c) where there is an urgent necessity for the resolution of the question and any further delay would prejudice the interests of the Government or of the petitioner or the subject matter of the action is perishable; (d) where, under the circumstances, a motion for reconsideration would be useless; (e) where petitioner was deprived of due process and there is extreme urgency for relief; (f) where, in a criminal case, relief from an order of arrest is urgent and the granting of such relief by the trial court is improbable; (g) where the proceedings in the lower court are a nullity for lack of due process; (h) where the proceedings were ex parte , or in which the petitioner had no opportunity to object; and (i) where the issue raised is one purely of law or where public interest is involved.\nWhile the petitioner cites exceptions (c), (d), (e), and (i) in her petition, she plainly did so without explaining how such circumstances apply to her case. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the second exception is more relevant in this case as the question raised by petitioner in her Verified Petition has been duly raised before and was already passed upon by the Sandiganbayan.\nExcusing the petitioner's procedural misstep notwithstanding, the petition fails.\nThere is grave abuse of discretion when there has been an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty prescribed by law or to act in accordance with law, such as when a judgment was rendered not on the basis of law and evidence, but on caprice, whim, and despotism.\nHere, the Court finds that no grave abuse of discretion may be attributed to the Sandiganbayan in the assailed Resolution, the same having been issued on cogent legal grounds.\nThe suspension pendente lite ordered in the assailed Resolution finds basis in Section 13 of R.A. 3019, to wit:\nSection 13. Suspension and loss of benefits.  Any incumbent public officer against whom any criminal prosecution under a valid information under this Act or under Title Seven Book II of the Revised Penal Code or for any offense involving fraud upon government or public funds or property whether as a simple or as complex offense and in whatever stage of execution and mode of participation, is pending in court shall be suspended from office. Should he be convicted by final judgement, he shall lose all retirement or gratuity benefits under any law, but if he is acquitted, he shall be entitled to reinstatement and to the salaries and benefits which he failed to receive during suspension, unless in the meantime administrative proceedings have been filed against him.\nIn the event that such convicted officer, who may have been separated from the service has already received such benefits he shall be liable to restitute the same to the government. (Emphasis and underscoring added)\nVerily, and contrary to petitioner's contention, the rule on preventive suspension is not limited to cases where there has been a violation of R.A. 3019 or Title 7, Book II of the RPC. The same Rule applies for any offense involving fraud upon government or public funds or property.\nThe relevant question now is whether the offense charged against petitioner is considered as fraud upon the government or public funds or property.\nIn Bustillo v. Sandiganbayan, this Court has settled that the term \"fraud,\" as used in Section 13 of R.A. 3019, is understood in its generic sense, that is, referring to \"an instance or an act of trickery or deceit especially when involving misrepresentation.\"\nThe Information filed against petitioner charged her and her co-accused with violation of Section 7(d) of R.A. 6713 by soliciting money and gifts from private individuals and entities for supposed tourism activities and projects of the City Government of Puerto Princesa, Palawan while in the performance of their functions and taking advantage of their positions as tourism officers. It is clear from the foregoing that the act of petitioner (and her co-accused) involves fraud upon public funds as such money and gifts solicited were collected for the purpose of funding the tourism activities of the City Government of Puerto Princesa, Palawan.\nIt is noteworthy that petitioner did not assail the validity of such Information. In fact, in her Manifestation and Compliance before the Sandiganbayan, petitioner begged exception to the suspension pendente lite that she admitted should be imposed on her under a \"valid information.\"\nIn Bolastig v. Sandiganbayan (Third Division), the Court underscored the mandatory nature of preventive suspension when a public officer is charged with a valid information involving violation of R.A. 3019, Title 7, Book II of the RPC, or offenses involving fraud upon government, public funds, or property:\nx x x [S]ec. 13 of Republic Act No. 3019 makes it mandatory for the Sandiganbayan to suspend any public officer against whom a valid information charging violation of that law, Book II, Title 7 of the Revised Penal Code, or any offense involving fraud upon government or public funds or property is filed. The court trying a case has neither discretion nor duty to determine whether preventive suspension is required to prevent the accused from using his office to intimidate witnesses or frustrate his prosecution or continue committing malfeasance in office. The presumption is that unless the accused is suspended he may frustrate his prosecution or commit further acts of malfeasance or do both, in the same way that upon a finding that there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof, the law requires the judge to issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused. The law does not require the court to determine whether the accused is likely to escape or evade the jurisdiction of the court. (citations omitted)\nSince the petitioner is charged with an offense that clearly falls under Section 13 of R.A. 3019, her suspension pendente lite is justified. The Sandiganbayan has no other option but to order the suspension of the petitioner when it is convinced that the information charges her with acts of fraud involving government funds.\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the instant petition is DISMISSED . The Resolution dated September 5, 2019 issued by the Sandiganbayan, Sixth Division in Criminal Case No. SB-17-CRM-1385 is hereby AFFIRMED .\nSO ORDERED.\nLeonen (Chairperson), Hernando, Inting, and Delos Santos, JJ., concur.","label":[[16,32,"CASE_NUM"],[34,48,"PROM_DATE"],[51,75,"PERSON"],[92,117,"INS"],[122,150,"INS"],[180,185,"PERSON"],[378,402,"PERSON"],[512,540,"INS"],[597,629,"CASE_NUM"],[678,689,"PERSON"],[691,710,"PERSON"],[716,733,"PERSON"],[763,795,"CASE_NUM"],[1246,1259,"INS"],[1294,1322,"RA"],[1692,1716,"PERSON"],[1790,1807,"PERSON"],[1839,1856,"PERSON"],[1892,1917,"PERSON"],[1922,1940,"PERSON"],[2716,2729,"INS"],[2845,2858,"INS"],[2991,3000,"RA"],[3113,3122,"RA"],[3216,3234,"STA"],[3236,3239,"STA"],[3278,3287,"RA"],[3340,3353,"INS"],[3467,3495,"PERSON"],[3707,3735,"PERSON"],[4076,4089,"INS"],[4207,4217,"RA"],[4331,4340,"RA"],[4369,4372,"STA"],[5157,5170,"INS"],[5252,5265,"INS"],[5495,5504,"RA"],[5595,5604,"RA"],[5978,6010,"CASE_NUM"],[6488,6511,"INS"],[6525,6557,"INS"],[6559,6562,"INS"],[6593,6602,"RA"],[6659,6672,"RA"],[6771,6780,"RA"],[6888,6901,"INS"],[7040,7043,"INS"],[7078,7091,"INS"],[7594,7603,"RA"],[7652,7665,"INS"],[9537,9542,"INS"],[9730,9743,"INS"],[10196,10209,"INS"],[10384,10393,"RA"],[10594,10612,"STA"],[11535,11544,"RA"],[11572,11575,"STA"],[11839,11852,"INS"],[11925,11934,"RA"],[12191,12200,"RA"],[12871,12884,"INS"],[13033,13046,"INS"],[13214,13223,"RA"],[13249,13252,"STA"],[13345,13366,"RA"],[13394,13407,"INS"],[13527,13545,"STA"],[14495,14504,"RA"],[14553,14566,"INS"],[14856,14869,"INS"],[14889,14921,"CASE_NUM"],[14955,14961,"PERSON"],[14977,14985,"PERSON"],[14987,14993,"PERSON"],[14999,15011,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":938,"text":"FIRST DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 252325, March 18, 2021 ]\nFLORITA B. VIRAY, PETITIONER, VS. HEIRS OF MILAGROS A. VIRAY, REPRESENTED BY JOHN A. VIRAY, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nCARANDANG, J.:\nAssailed in this Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is the Resolution dated September 10, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 148926, which granted Florita B. Viray's (petitioner) Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss Appeal and deemed the case closed and terminated. Likewise assailed is the Resolution dated March 3, 2020, which denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.\nFacts of the Case\nThis case stemmed from a complaint for unlawful detainer filed by Milagros A. Viray (now substituted by respondents heirs) against petitioner before the Metropolitan Trial Court (METC) of Mandaluyong City, Branch 60.\nMilagros A. Viray (Milagros) alleged that she is the lawful owner of a stall space in a commercial building located at 427 Barangka Drive comer Tanglaw St., Mandaluyong City built on the land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 25216 registered in her name and declared for taxation purposes. In July 1993, Milagros verbally leased the said stall to petitioner, her daughter-in-law, the wife of her son, Julito Viray (Julito). The daily rent was P400.. On May 1, 2013, petitioner failed to pay the daily rental, and as of May 1, 2014, petitioner had arrears amounting to P73,000..\nIt was agreed upon by the parties that petitioner will use the stall for selling dressed chicken only. However, in 2010, Milagros claimed that petitioner violated the terms of the lease when the latter started to use the stall as storage facility and for dressing live chicken. Petitioner also used gas stove emitting foul odor affecting the health of Milagros whose room is adjacent to the stall. Milagros, being bedridden, needs expansion of her room for ventilation and the stall space is needed for such improvement. Settlement before the barangay failed. A demand to pay the rentals in arrears and to vacate the stall was sent to petitioner on May 20, 2014 to no avail. Hence, this complaint.\nIn her Answer, petitioner countered that the lot is co-owned by Milagros and her children as heirs to the estate of Chan Lee a.k.a. Jose Viray, Milagros' late husband, who died on January 22, 1995. The lot used to be part of a bigger lot covered by TCT No. 2870, a conjugal property of Chan Lee and Milagros. After the death of Chan Lee, Milagros, without settling the estate of her husband, subdivided the lot resulting in the issuance of three separate titles one of which is TCT No. 25216. Petitioner occupied the stall not as lessee but as wife of Julito, co-owner of the said property. The amount being paid is not rent but financial aid or assistance to show gratitude to Milagros. Petitioner used the stall so that she and her husband would have a means of livelihood. The stall is being used to sell dressed and live chicken which is known to Milagros. The noise coming therefrom is normal and the place is clean, fit for selling poultry meat. Petitioner averred that Milagros owns a place that could be her residence other that the room near the stall. Her husband's condition is even worse than Milagros, as he has been bedridden after an accident and is immobile. Selling dressed chicken in the stall is petitioner's only source of income to make a living and to support the medical needs of her husband. Petitioner claimed that she is not legally bound to pay rental since the property is partly owned by her husband; hence, she could not be ejected therefrom.\nRuling of the Metropolitan Trial Court\nAfter submission of their respective position papers, the METC rendered a Decision dated August 11, 2015 granting the complaint, ordering petitioner and all persons claiming rights under her to vacate the stall and restore its possession to Milagros; to pay the amount of P400. daily reckoned from July 23, 2014 until they have vacated the premises; to pay P10,000. as and by way of attorney's fees; and the cost of suit. While petitioner avers that there is no lease to speak of since what she is giving Milagros is in the form of financial assistance, said financial assistance started from the time they occupied the place; therefore, petitioner's occupation of the stall is merely tolerated and Milagros has the right to demand that petitioner vacate the same.\nPetitioner filed an appeal to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Mandaluyong City, Branch 211.\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court\nOn August 22, 2016, the RfC affirmed in toto the decision of the METC. It ruled that being a torrens title holder, Milagros is entitled to all the attributes of property ownership, which necessarily includes possession. As to the issue of title raised by petitioner that she co-owns the property in representation of her husband, the RTC declared that said issue should be properly ventilated in an appropriate legal proceeding and not in the instant case where the issue pertains only to possession. Milagros has sufficiently alleged in her complaint that petitioner was allowed to use the subject premises only to sell dress chicken for a daily rental of P400. which was the subject of an oral contract. Petitioner's possession became illegal when Milagros sent her demand letter to pay the unpaid rental and vacate the subject property which petitioner failed to heed.\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration but it was denied in the Order dated November 16, 2016.\nA petition for review under Rule 42 was thereafter filed by petitioner to the CA.\nDuring the pendency of the case in the CA, Milagros died on July 18, 2017. She was substituted by her heirs, John, Julito, and Marcelino, Jr., as represented by John A. Viray.\nThereafter, petitioner filed a Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss Appeal praying that the ejectment case be dismissed. Petitioner claimed that since the property is now under co-ownership and one of its co-owners is Julito, her husband, a situation arises where a co-owner becomes a party against his wife which is a strange case. Petitioner claimed that a co-owner cannot be ejected from a portion of an undivided property.\nRespondents filed a comment objecting to dismiss the case and that the case be resolved by the CA on the merits \"to educate the parties\" on the issues raised in the petition.\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\nIn the Resolution dated September 10, 2018, the CA granted petitioner's Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss Appeal and considered the case closed and terminated. It directed the Division Clerk of Court to issue an Entry of Judgment. Citing Section 3, Rule 50 of the Revised Rules of Court, the CA stated that the filing of the manifestation with motion to dismiss appeal has the effect of withdrawal of petitioner's petition for review. Records show that petitioner aims to put an end to the subject ejectment case in order to avoid conflict between her and Julito, her husband.\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration asserting that she never intended to have her petition dismissed, but the original ejectment case. 1aшphi1 While she erroneously titled it as Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss Appeal, it should have been manifestation with motion to dismiss case, referring to the ejectment case, which is the subject of her pending petition.\nIn the Resolution dated March 3, 2020, the CA denied the motion. It ruled that the Decision dated September 10, 2018 has attained finality; thus, immutable and unalterable.\nHence, this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 filed by petitioner.\nDuring the pendency of the case before the Court, respondent filed a Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution, which was granted by the METC in its Order dated February 7, 2020. A writ of execution and notice to vacate was issued.\nPetitioner moved to recall\/quash the writ of execution and notice to vacate before the METC; however, it was not acted upon. Hence, petitioner filed a petition for mandamus under Rule 65 with preliminary injunction before the RTC of Mandaluyong City, Branch 208. She sought to enjoin the implementation of the writ of execution and notice to vacate because of a change of the situation of the parties, claiming that petitioner is now a part owner of the property upon the death of her husband.\nOn September 22, 2020, the RTC, Branch 208 issued temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the Judge and Sheriff of the METC, Branch 60, from implementing the writ of execution and notice to pay and vacate within 72-hours. Petitioner asked for an extension of the TRO for 17 days, which was denied by the RTC in its Order dated September 24, 2020.\nIssue\nThe issue in this case is whether the CA correctly resolved that petitioner's Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss Appeal has the effect of withdrawal of petitioner's petition for review.\nPetitioner's Arguments\nPetitioner argues that while she mistakenly filed a Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss Appeal, she was asking for the dismissal of the ejectment complaint, and not her petition for review. In every pleading or motion, the allegations therein control and should prevail over the caption or title. Petitioner claims that the CA erred in declaring the dismissal order as final and executory and beyond recall. Petitioner timely filed a motion for reconsideration to assail the Resolution dated September 10, 2018. With the death of Milagros, Julito became the owner of 1\/3 of the subject property. It is a portion of this property where she earns by selling meat products which she uses to defray the monthly expenses of around P80,000. for the subsistence of her husband. To eject petitioner is in effect to deprive her husband of his right to continue utilizing the place for business, whose income assures him of daily survival and violates his right as an owner.\nRespondents' Comment\nRespondents aver that the CA did not err when it dismissed the appeal. Petitioner is the party being ejected and not her husband. Petitioner is allowed to engage in business and can enter into contract independent of her husband. According to respondents, petitioner's contention that she cannot be ejected since her husband is a co-owner of the property and the absurdity that a husband will eject his wife from the premises should not be considered. Respondents' cause of action to file the ejectment case already existed at the time when the demand to pay and vacate the premises was made on May 20, 2014.\nFurther, respondents contend that petitioner's Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss Appeal is a clear abandonment and waiver of her right to appeal to the CA the decision of the RTC. Contrary to petitioner's assertion, respondents argue that there is no co-ownership between respondents and petitioner's husband since Milagros had already sold the property to her son, respondent John A. Viray, as evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale dated November 16, 2015. Said sale is a supervening event that erased her husband's claim of co-ownership. Finally, when petitioner agreed to leased the property in January 1993, she recognized the rights of Milagros as lessor and owner thereof.\nRuling of the Court\nThe petition is meritorious.\nAfter a judicious review of the records of the case, the Court finds that the CA erred in ruling that the filing of the Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss Appeal has the effect of withdrawal of petitioner's petition for review under Rule 42. When the CA considered the case closed and terminated and directed the Division Clerk of Court to issue an Entry of Judgment, the CA in effect affirmed the ruling of the METC and the RTC ordering petitioner and all persons claiming rights under her to vacate the stall and restore its possession to Milagros. This is the basis of the final and executory judgment against petitioner, which is clearly erroneous.\nThe CA misunderstood the import of the Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss Appeal filed by petitioner. A simple reading thereof simply means that petitioner seeks to dismiss the ejectment case, and not her petition for review with the CA. What matters is not the caption of the pleading but the allegations contained therein. It is clear that in view of the death of Milagros, her husband as son of the registered owner Milagros, becomes a co-owner of the property, and cannot be ejected from a portion of the undivided property.\nFor an unlawful detainer action to prosper, the plaintiff must allege and establish the following key jurisdictional facts: (I) initially, possession of property by the defendant was by contract with, or by tolerance of, the plaintiff; (2) eventually, such possession became illegal upon notice by the plaintiff to the defendant of the termination of the latter's right of possession; (3) thereafter, the defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of the enjoyment thereof; and (4) within one year from the last demand on the defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, it is reasonable for the Court to consider that that there was neither an oral lease between Milagros and petitioner, nor was there tolerance from the beginning of petitioner's possession of the property in 1993. The court is more inclined to believe that the amount given by petitioner to Milagros was in the form of a financial assistance given to Milagros, and not payment of rentals.\nThe TCT No. 25216 was registered in the name of Milagros on December 10, 2009. The complaint for unlawful detainer was filed in July 2014. Milagros alleged in the complaint that the tolerance started in 1993 when she verbally leased the stall to petitioner.\nIn 1993, the subject property was still part of the conjugal properties of spouses Chan Lee a.k.a. Jose Viray and Milagros. Even assuming that petitioner's possession of the property in 1993 was by tolerance of Milagros, Julito became a co-owner of the property upon the death of her father, Chan Lee, on January 22, 1995. From 1995 to 2009, before the title was registered in the name of Milagros, petitioner's possession of the subject property was by virtue of co-ownership. In an unlawful detainer case, the key jurisdictional fact that should be proved is that the acts of tolerance should have been present right from the very start of possession, and We may hasten to add, that such nature of possession by tolerance shall continue up to the filing of the ejectment complaint. When Milagros filed a complaint for unlawful detainer in 2014, she failed to establish that petitioner's possession of the subject property was tolerated all the way from the very beginning. In the absence of proof of tolerated possession up to the filing of the complaint for unlawful detainer, the jurisdictional element of an illegal detainer case is not satisfied.\nAssuming that tolerance was given to the couple by Milagros when she became the registered owner of the property in 2009. This is not the basis of the cause of action because the complaint alleges that she tolerated petitioner's occupation of the premises since 1993.\nThere is no need to discuss the legal consequences of the Deed of Sale executed by Milagros to John Viray in November 16, 2015, since it is not a material issue litigated in this ejectment case.\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the instant petition is GRANTED . The Resolutions dated September 10, 2018 and March 3, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 148926 are SET ASIDE . The complaint for unlawful detainer in Civil Case No. 23256 is hereby DISMISSED for lack of cause of action.\nSO ORDERED.\nPeralta, C.J., Caguioa, Zalameda, and Gaerlan, JJ., concur.","label":[[17,32,"CASE_NUM"],[34,48,"PROM_DATE"],[51,79,"PERSON"],[94,111,"PERSON"],[128,141,"PERSON"],[172,181,"PERSON"],[244,251,"STA"],[324,340,"INS"],[342,344,"INS"],[349,370,"CASE_NUM"],[386,402,"PERSON"],[700,717,"PERSON"],[787,811,"INS"],[813,817,"INS"],[851,868,"PERSON"],[870,878,"PERSON"],[1173,1181,"PERSON"],[1270,1282,"PERSON"],[1284,1290,"PERSON"],[1568,1576,"PERSON"],[1799,1807,"PERSON"],[1845,1853,"PERSON"],[2209,2217,"PERSON"],[2261,2269,"PERSON"],[2277,2287,"PERSON"],[2289,2297,"PERSON"],[2431,2439,"PERSON"],[2444,2452,"PERSON"],[2473,2481,"PERSON"],[2483,2491,"PERSON"],[2823,2831,"PERSON"],[2996,3004,"PERSON"],[3121,3129,"PERSON"],[3250,3258,"PERSON"],[3632,3656,"INS"],[3715,3719,"INS"],[3898,3906,"PERSON"],[4162,4171,"PERSON"],[4356,4364,"PERSON"],[4456,4476,"INS"],[4478,4481,"INS"],[4530,4550,"INS"],[4616,4620,"INS"],[4666,4674,"PERSON"],[4885,4888,"INS"],[5052,5060,"PERSON"],[5301,5309,"PERSON"],[5544,5551,"STA"],[5594,5596,"INS"],[5637,5639,"INS"],[5641,5649,"PERSON"],[5707,5711,"PERSON"],[5713,5719,"PERSON"],[5724,5739,"PERSON"],[5759,5772,"PERSON"],[5992,5998,"PERSON"],[6296,6298,"PERSON"],[6390,6406,"INS"],[6455,6457,"INS"],[6659,6666,"STA"],[6682,6696,"STA"],[6702,6704,"INS"],[7396,7398,"INS"],[7743,7747,"INS"],[7925,7929,"INS"],[8017,8024,"STA"],[8064,8067,"INS"],[8359,8362,"INS"],[8455,8459,"INS"],[8640,8643,"INS"],[8727,8729,"INS"],[9225,9227,"INS"],[9431,9439,"PERSON"],[9441,9447,"PERSON"],[9913,9915,"INS"],[10651,10653,"INS"],[10814,10822,"PERSON"],[10876,10889,"PERSON"],[11139,11147,"PERSON"],[11304,11306,"INS"],[11462,11468,"STA"],[11479,11481,"INS"],[11600,11602,"INS"],[11640,11644,"INS"],[11653,11656,"INS"],[11885,11887,"INS"],[12117,12119,"INS"],[12249,12257,"PERSON"],[12302,12310,"PERSON"],[13190,13198,"PERSON"],[13387,13395,"PERSON"],[13447,13455,"PERSON"],[13533,13541,"PERSON"],[13624,13632,"PERSON"],[13826,13834,"PERSON"],[13842,13852,"PERSON"],[13857,13865,"PERSON"],[13954,13962,"PERSON"],[13964,13970,"PERSON"],[14035,14043,"PERSON"],[14132,14140,"PERSON"],[14532,14540,"PERSON"],[14947,14955,"PERSON"],[15247,15255,"PERSON"],[15259,15269,"PERSON"],[15492,15508,"PERSON"],[15512,15533,"CASE_NUM"],[15589,15609,"CASE_NUM"],[15671,15684,"PERSON"],[15686,15693,"PERSON"],[15695,15703,"PERSON"],[15709,15716,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":939,"text":"THIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 240507, April 28, 2021 ]\nASIAN TERMINALS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. ETELIANO R. REYES, JR., RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nLOPEZ, J., J.:\nThis is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Decision dated January 18, 2018 and the Resolution dated June 27, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 146498.\nFACTS:\nEteliano Reyes, Jr. (Reyes) was employed by Asian Terminals Inc., (ATI) as Supervisor III\/Foreman on Board who shall be responsible in ensuring that shift vessel operations are carried in accordance with ATI standards.\nOn February 17, 2014, Reyes was supervising the loading and lashing operations at Q7 on board MV YH Ideals. He first went to Bay 30, but he had to leave the All Purpose Personnel (APP) tasked to finish the lashing operations as he needed to supervise the loading operations at Bay 38. With a twist of fate, an accident occurred at Bay 30 wherein a lashing bar fell on the pier apron hitting Manuel Quiban (Quiban) a vessel security guard.\nAs expected, ATI directed Reyes to explain why he should not be penalized for negligence under Section 2. of the Company Table of Offenses and Penalties (CTOP).\nIn his response, Reyes clarified that while completing the lashing operations at Bay 30, \"EC Planner\" directed him to transfer to Bay 38 to supervise the commencement of loading operations. Pursuant to said instruction, Reyes left the four (4) AP Ps to complete lashing operations at Bay 30 and proceeded to Bay 38 where a loading operation was about to start and the crane was already positioned.\nIn a Notice to Explain with Preventive Suspension dated February 21, 2014, the ATI informed Reyes that his failure to ensure that the safeguards for works on board the vessel were faithfully observed constitutes probable violation under Section 2. of the CTOP (neglect of work, incompetence, inefficiency, negligence, failure to perform duties and\/or responsibilities, or failure to observe standard operating procedures, in any case resulting in injury or death) and may merit the penalty of dismissal.\nConsequently, Reyes filed his supplemental response expounding on the necessity to transfer from Bay 30 to Bay 38. According to him, he needed to go to Bay 38 to ensure that the containers on deck are secured in accordance with the loading plan. Beseeching consideration, Reyes reminded ATI of his satisfactory performance for the past three (3) years and his consistent diligence in the discharge of his duties.\nUnmoved by Reyes' entreaty, ATI terminated his employment prompting Reyes to file a complaint for illegal dismissal.\nTHE RULING OF THE LABOR ARBITER\nFinding that Reyes failed to prove the illegality of his dismissal, the Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the complaint for lack of merit, but awarded service incentive leave and 13th month pay, thus:\nWHEREFORE , a Decision is hereby rendered declaring that the dismissal of the Complainant was valid, However, Respondents are hereby ordered to pay Complainant service incentive leave pay and 13th month pay,\nComputation is as follows:\nSO ORDERED.\nATI and Reyes filed their respective appeals to the National Labor Relations Commission.\nTHE NLRC RULING\nIn a Decision dated March 8, 2016, the NLRC reversed the findings of the LA as to the legality of Reyes' dismissal and modified the monetary award. The NLRC ratiocinated as follows:\nThe Labor Arbiter was simplistic in her approach in resolving the issue of negligence.\nHer logic is that since complainant left Bay 30 before the lashing operation was completed; that he did not leave instructions to the All Purpose Personnel left behind; and there was no urgency in leaving Bay 30 for Bay 38, he was thus negligent.\nThe Labor Arbiter should have taken into account the following circumstances before deciding that complainant was negligent, viz :\na. Complainant before the loading and lashing operations conducted the Tool Box among his subordinates, a safety requirement before starting the work. It means he conducted an orientation about the safety procedures vis-a-vis the loading and lashing operations;\nb. He personally supervised the lashing operations and observed if the AP Ps were doing it correctly. It was only when everything was correctly done that he left Bay 30 for Bay 38;\nc. Complainant's going to Bay 38 was in accordance with the schedule of the Quay Crane 7 which was now transferred to Bay 38 to commence loading. This action to transfer QC 7 to Bay 38 is normal as it is dictated by the work program of the crane. Complainant did not wait for the completion of the lashing at Bay 30 since he had to check Bay 38 if the twist and shoe lock are properly placed before the loading starts. As QC 7 supervisor on board, he had to supervise and guide the QC Operator in loading operations. As a rule, all QC operators are not supposed to make any movement, i.e., travelling, discharging and loading without the presence of a supervisor assigned for each QC. His presence in Bay 38 was thus necessary.\nWhen complainant transferred to Bay 38 from Bay 30, he was merely following the instructions of the EC Planner to transfer QC 7 to Bay 38 to commence loading. At the expense of being trite, the procedure for loading and lashing or fastening of cargoes is this: There is no need to wait for the lashing operations to be completed on Bay and to start loading the cross bay or another bay which sufficiently stands between the two bays. Waiting will only result in undue delays due to the fast pace of operations at the pier since vessels, local and international, have a schedule to follow.\nIn the maritime business, time is gold and of the essence since undue delays disrupt the vessels scheduled (sic) and may result in the payment of demurrage fees.\nFinally, We also find that the injured security guard on board had no business walking at the apron of a NO WALK ZONE AREA without permission.\nComplainant was initially charged with negligence under the company's Revised Table of Offenses (TOP) 2. which provides a graduated penalty, thus: 1st offense  15 days suspension; 2nd offense  30 days suspension and 3rd offense  dismissal[,] through a Notice to Explain dated 18th February 2014. Complainant submitted his well-written explanation the following day. Two days thereafter, he was charged with another offense. This time under TOP 2. which provides for a sanction of dismissal. Subsequently[,] or on 24th March 2014, he was dismissed.\nWe believe that complainant's dismissal under the new charge is unwarranted. While it is respondent ATI['s] management prerogative to prescribe rules and regulations to discipline its employees and to impose sanctions on erring workers, the exercise of this prerogative is not unlimited, boundless[,] and absolute. x x x\nGiven the fact that complainant followed the rules in the performance of his job and the furt.h.er fact that the incident resulting to injury to the guard would not have happened were it not for the latter's negligence in being in a place he was not authorized to, the imposition of the ultimate penalty of dismissal on complainant violates the rule of fair play and labor justice.\nTo recall, complainant was charged with negligence first under TOP 2. and later under TOP 2.[.] Negligence to be a basis for termination of employment must be gross and habitual. \"The concept of negligence as enunciated in Article 282 (b) [now renumbered as Article (b)], must not only be gross but habitual in character as well to justify depriving the employee of his means of livelihood\" x x x.\nx x x x\nAssuming complainant is guilty of negligence, let it be stressed that in his three years with respondent company, this is his first. Obviously[,] this is not a case of gross and habitual negligence that jurisprudence speaks about as ground for termination of employment. That said, this Commission finds his dismissal unjustified and illegal and as a consequence thereof, he should be reinstated without loss of seniority rights and with full back wages.\nWe agree, however, with respondent that the Labor Arbiter erred in the computation of benefits awarded the complainant. x x x. What appears complainant is entitled to, and the respondent completely is in agreement, is the former's proportionate 13th month pay and SILP for the period January to March 2014 in the amounts of Php10,650. and Php4,594. respectively or the total sum of Php15,245..\nWHEREFORE , finding both Appeals to be impressed with merit, they are both granted. The Decision of the Labor Arbiter is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a NEW ONE rendered as follows:\n1. Complainant Eteliano R. Reyes, Jr. is declared illegally dismissed and ordered immediate[ly] reinstated, paid his back wages of P28,000. a month reckoned from March 24,2014 until finality of the judgment without loss of seniority rights and privileges; and\n2. Respondents Asian Terminal Inc. is ordered to pay his proportionate 13th month pay and SILP for 2014 in the sum of P15,245..\nAll other claims are dismissed for lack of merit.\nSO ORDERED.\nATI moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied m a Resolution dated April 27, 2016.\nDismayed by the NLRC's disposition, ATI instituted a Petition for Certiorari before the CA.\nTHE CA RULING\nOn January 18, 2018, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which states:\nWHEREFORE , the instant petition for certiorari is DISMISSED . Accordingly, the March 8, 2016 Decision and April 27, 2016 Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission, Fourth Division in NLRC LAC No. 10-002783-15 are AFFIRMED .\nATI's motion for reconsideration was also denied m the assailed Resolution dated June 27, 2018.\nHence, the present petition.\nISSUE\nWhether or not the CA erred in ruling that no grave abuse of discretion was committed by the NLRC in denying petitioner's assertion of valid dismissal.\nATI maintains the validity of Reyes' termination from employment. ATI argues that as a company engaged in container yardwork, which involves the operation of huge industrial equipment to pick-up cargoes\/containers at ports, it needs to ensure that industrial safety protocols are followed by all ATI personnel and third persons such that any deviation therefrom is not taken lightly. ATI adds that it puts high premium on the safety of its employees and workplace environment, that even a first offense caused by non-observance of safety standards where injury or death results, is meted the penalty of dismissal. According to ATI, since Reyes violated his duty in ensuring safety in shift vessel operations which caused injury to a third person, his dismissal is necessarily called for. For the first time, ATI advances that should this Court deem Reyes' dismissal as invalid, it shall be made liable to pay for his separation in lieu of reinstatement.\nFor Reyes, he asserts that he was illegally dismissed. He insists that the ATI failed to adduce clear, consistent, accurate, and convincing evidence to support the legality of his termination from employment.\nTHIS COURT'S RULING\nATI's arguments fail to convince.\nFirst, ATI's arguments are mainly questions of fact and are generally not subject to review by the Court in a Rule 45 petition. Only questions of law may be raised in a petition filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.\nSecond, in a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the petitioner must establish that the respondent tribunal acted in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary, or despotic manner in the exercise of its jurisdiction as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. As correctly observed by the CA, the petition before it failed to indicate with exactitude and substantiate that the NLRC acted in such a way that would amount to lack of jurisdiction. What the petitioner questioned was the NLRC's appreciation of the evidence before it which pertains to an error of judgment rather than an error of jurisdiction.\nThird, the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion. There is grave abuse of discretion when rendition of judgment was done in a capricious, whimsical, or arbitrary manner tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. Moreover, the concept of \"grave\" connotes that the abuse of discretion is so gross and patent that amounts to \"an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.\" Here, the NLRC's decision, which upheld the illegality of Reyes' dismissal, has basis in evidence as well as in law and jurisprudence, hence, no grave abuse of discretion may be imputed against it.\nAlso, settled is the rule that in illegal dismissal cases, the employer bears the burden of proving that the termination of the employee was for a valid or authorized cause. This is consistent with the principle of security of tenure as guaranteed by the Constitution and reinforced by Article 292(b) of the Labor Code of the Philippines, which provides:\nArt. 292. Miscellaneous Provisions - x x x\n(b) Subject to the constitutional right of workers to security of tenure and their right to be protected against dismissal except for a just and authorized cause and without prejudice to the requirement of notice under Article of this Code, the employer shall furnish the worker whose employment is sought to be terminated a written notice containing a statement of the causes for termination and shall afford the latter ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself with the assistance of his representative if he so desires in accordance with company rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to guidelines set by the Department of Labor and Employment. Any decision taken by the employer shall be without prejudice to the right of the worker to contest the validity or legality of his dismissal by filing a complaint with the regional branch of the National Labor Relations Commission. The burden of proving that the termination was for a valid or authorized cause shall rest on the employer. x x x\nIndeed, as pointed out by the CA, ATI failed to present clear, accurate, positive, and convincing evidence that there is just cause to terminate Reyes' employment. ℒαwρhi৷ For one, Reyes merely followed the rules in the performance of his job. In fact, his transfer to Bay 38 was by instructions of the EC Planner. Too, his transfer to Bay 38 was necessary because a quay crane has already been prepositioned and loading operation was about to commence.\nWithal, We find no reversible error committed by the CA in finding that no grave abuse of discretion is attributable to the NLRC.\nATI advances, for the first time, that reinstatement is not the feasible alternative but the payment of separation pay in view of the strained relations of the parties.\nWe do not agree.\nIn Rodriguez vs. Sintron Systems, Inc., this Court elaborated that the doctrine of strained relations cannot be applied indiscriminately since every labor dispute almost invariably results in \"strained relations\"; otherwise, reinstatement can never be possible simply because some hostility is engendered between the parties as a result of their disagreement. That is human nature. Strained relations must be demonstrated as a fact. The doctrine should not be used recklessly or loosely applied, nor be based on impression alone.\nReinstatement cannot be barred especially when the employee has not indicated an aversion to returning to work, or does not occupy a position of trust and confidence, or has no say in the operation of the employer's business.\nHere, aside from the fact that this issue was only raised for the first time, there is also no compelling evidence presented to support the conclusion that the parties' relationship has gone so sour so as to render reinstatement impracticable. Also, Reyes has not demonstrated unwillingness to be reinstated and the existence of a confidential relationship between him, as a supervisory employee, and ATI, has not been established.

{"id":940,"text":"FIRST DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 217338, March 18, 2021 ]\nDINO S. PALO, PETITIONER, VS. SENATOR CREWING (MANILA), INC., ET AL., RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nCARANDANG, J.:\nBefore Us is an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Dino Palo (Palo) assailing the Resolution dated September 3, 2014 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 136807.\nFacts of the Case\nRespondent company Senator Crewing (Manila), Inc. (SCI), acting for and on behalf of its foreign principal Columbia Ship Management Ltd., hired Palo as Oiler for a six-month contract term. On September 24, 2011 and after being declared as fit to work in his Pre-employment Medical Examination (PEME), Palo was deployed onboard the vessel M\/S CMA CGM Verlaine.\nSometime in the first week of December 2011 and while working on board the vessel, Palo carried a container of chemical cleaners weighing 25 kiloliters down the stairs from the engine room's upper floor. Palo suddenly felt a snap on his back and the pain began radiating down to his hips. Palo continued to work as the pain was initially tolerable. Several days later, the pain intensified again. As a result, the employer referred Palo for medical examination at a hospital in Mexico where he was initially diagnosed with \"Left Lumbociatic, Lumbar Spondilo Artrosis.\" However, Palo was not recommended for medical repatriation. On March 25, 2012, Palo was repatriated due to the end of his employment contract. Upon arrival in the Philippines, Palo was not provided medical attention by the company-designated physicians.\nOn April 25, 2012, Palo signed another six-month contract with SCI as Oiler on board L\/T Cortesia. His employment contract is covered by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Before deployment, Palo was subjected to another PEME, where he was declared fit for sea duty. Palo claimed that he was no longer subjected to a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam due to lack of time and was allowed to board L\/T Cortesia immediately.\nOn July 7, 2012, while Palo was lifting a pump motor weighing 30 kilograms, he fell to his knees due to unbearable pain on his back. The medic onboard the ship provided pain relievers for Palo. On September 14, 2012, the employer referred Palo for medical examination at a hospital in Malaysia for his back pain. The physicians in Malaysia recommended the surgical procedures namely: foraminotomy, laminotomy and discectomy to be performed on Palo. Palo preferred that surgery be done in the Philippines. However, as L\/T Cortesia was headed for England, the physicians from Malaysia recommended that Palo be examined again in England. Palo was given light duties during the course of his employment, but as he was still suffering from back pain, his employer brought him to a hospital in England for medical examination. The physicians from England recommended Palo's medical repatriation.\nOn October 6, 2012, or upon Palo's arrival in the Philippines, SCI immediately referred him to the company-designated physicians. The company-designated physician issued their initial impression finding that Palo has \"L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 Disc Desiccation; L3-L4 Generalized Disc Bulge; L4-L5, Left-sided Disc Bulge with Foraminal Narrowing.\" On December 21, 2012, Palo was admitted for surgery. Six days later or on December 27, 2012, Palo was discharged. On March 19, 2013 or 164 days from Palo's repatriation, the company-designated physician issued a certification stating that Palo had undergone medical\/ surgical evaluation from October 8, 2012 until March 19, 2013 for his back conditions. On March 22, 2013, without any certification of his disability grading or fitness to return to work, Palo sought to consult with his personal physician, who assessed him to be totally and permanently disabled due to a work-related illness. On the same day, he filed a complaint for payment of disability benefits with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).\nSCI, on the other hand, held that Palo is not entitled to payment of disability benefits because he committed fraudulent misrepresentation by concealing his pre-existing medical conditions to the company. Palo failed to mention in his PEME for the L\/T Cortesia employment contract that he had previous or existing conditions with his back. The company only learned of Palo's pre-existing back conditions when the company-designated physicians had examined him after his medical repatriation. Per the report of the company-designated physicians dated October 23, 2012, Palo had been examined by the physicians from his previous employment \"from October 24, 2001 up to 20 February 2002 for \"Mild Disc Bulge L1-L2 and L4-L5; small right paracentral and foraminal disc protrusion, L1-L2 level and was declared fit to work on February 20, 2002.\" The company also claimed that there were no reports that Palo suffered an accident while onboard the vessel. In fact, during the separated consults abroad, Palo never claimed that he suffered from an accident that caused his back pains. If Palo were to be paid disability benefits, he is only entitled to receive partial benefits because the company designated physicians assessed his back condition with a Grade 8 rating described as \"moderate rigidity or 2\/3 loss of truncal motion.\"\nRuling of the Labor Arbiter\nIn a Decision dated November 21, 2013, the Labor Arbiter (LA) granted Palo's claim for payment of permanent and total disability benefits. As Palo had been examined during the term of his contract and was recommended for medical repatriation, the LA held that his injury was work-related. Further, the nature of his work as Oiler includes regularly carrying heavy objects. The LA did not give credence to SCI's claim of misrepresentation in the PEME. The LA found it illogical for the Masters of the vessel to repeatedly send Palo ashore for examination and treatment without knowledge of his injury in the course of employment. Moreover, the fact that Palo finished his contract onboard MIS CMA CGM Verlaine and was not recommended for medical repatriation did not \"defract\" from the fact that he suffered an injury onboard the vessel. The LA held that there were medical certificates of consultation during his term of contract onboard M\/S CMA CGM Verlaine, which proves that during the term of employment, he sustained an injury causing his back pain. Further, the medical reports on physical examination and surgical intervention also validated that Palo sustained injury while onboard L\/T Cortesia. The law allows a seafarer to claim disability benefits for an injury even if not resulting from an accident. Thus, Palo is entitled to payment of disability benefits. Finally, Palo's injury is considered permanent and total because the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) requires the company-designated physician to issue an assessment stating the degree of disability not exceeding 120 days. As the Grade 8 assessment had been issued to Palo beyond 120 days, his disability is deemed permanent and total. The LA ordered payment of US$60,000. as permanent and total disability benefits, a total of P200,000. as moral and exemplary damages and 10% attorney's fees.\nRuling of the National Labor Relations Commission\nSCI filed an appeal with the NLRC. In a Decision dated April 30, 2014, the NLRC reversed and set aside the decision of the LA. Following Section 20(E) of the POEA-SEC, a seafarer who knowingly conceals a pre-existing illness or condition in the PEME shall be liable for misrepresentation and shall be disqualified from any compensation and benefits. Palo failed to indicate in his PEME for the L\/T Cortesia contract that he had suffered from or has been diagnosed with back conditions. He only declared his previous operation for hemorrhoids. SCI was able to establish that Palo had a history of back problems as early as 2001. In fact, during Palo's medical consultations with the company-designated physicians, he confirmed that he had been suffering from back pain for more than a year. The NLRC was unconvinced of Palo's defense that the company knew of his back injury while onboard M\/V CMA CGM. VERLAINE, prior to the contract for L\/T Cortesia. The NLRC emphasized that Palo's non-disclosure referred to the 2001 diagnosis of the physicians from his previous employment and not the incident on M\/V CMA CGM VERLAINE. Finding that Palo concealed his pre-existing back conditions, the NLRC held that he is disqualified from receiving total and permanent disability benefits, damages, and attorney's fees.\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\nPalo then filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with the Court CA. In a Resolution dated September 3, 2014, the CA denied the petition outright for Palo's failure to state the material dates regarding the timeliness of filing the petition and the addresses of respondents. Palo moved to reconsider the foregoing resolution and included in his motion the missing particulars, which was still denied by the CA.\nPetitioner's Arguments\nPalo filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, arguing that the CA erred in dismissing his case outright. He claims that the failure to indicate respondents' addresses and material dates on timeliness in filing the petition for certiorari was due to his counsel's heavy workload, particularly, preparation of multiple pleadings and several court appearances. The lacking material dates and addresses of respondents were rectified in his motion for reconsideration timely filed with the CA. The CA gravely erred in applying the rules stringently, especially when the procedural lapses have been corrected.\nRespondent's Arguments\nIn its Comment, SCI argued that heavy workload is not a reasonable excuse to be exempted from the application of the rules. There must be a persuasive explanation of the failure to properly observe the rules. Further, the 60 days provided under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is more than sufficient time to file the petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeal.\nRuling of the Court\nThe CA dismissed outright Palo's petition for certiorari for failure to indicate the addresses of respondents and the material dates that show the timeliness of the petition. Failure to comply with any of the foregoing requirements shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition. Indeed, rules of procedure are mere tools designed to expedite the resolution of cases and other matters pending in court. However, when the strict and rigid application of the rules would frustrate rather than promote justice, liberally applying procedural rules may be allowed.\nOn record, Palo provided the foregoing particulars in his motion for reconsideration filed with the CA. In view of Palo's compliance with the missing particulars, We deem it prudent that the case be ruled on the merits to advance substantial justice. As Palo's petition was dismissed outright by the CA, the ordinary course would be to remand the case to the CA for further proceedings. However, the Court may dispense with said procedure to prevent further delays in the disposition of the case. Furthermore, the complete records of this case have already been elevated allowing this Court to resolve the dispute in a single proceeding instead of remanding to the CA. The instant petition assails a Resolution of the CA which dates back from 2014. Thus, to remand the case would be contrary to the speedy administration of justice. Instead of remanding the case to the CA, We will resolve the same to serve the ends of justice.\nIssue\nThe sole issue to be resolved is whether Palo is entitled to disability benefits.\nSCI claimed that Palo should not be paid disability benefits due to his failure in disclosing a previous diagnosis from 2001 relating to his back condition. Under Section 20(E) of the POEA-SEC, a seafarer who knowingly conceals his pre-existing illness or condition in the PEME is liable for misrepresentation and is disqualified from receiving compensation and benefits under the POEA-SEC. The rule seeks to penalize a seafarer who conceals information to pass the pre-employment medical examination. To negate compensability, it requires fraudulent misrepresentation, where falsity is coupled with intent to deceive and to profit from that deception.\nWe hold that Palo is not liable for fraudulent misrepresentation. Here, it is undisputed that Palo experienced back pain onboard M\/S CMA CGM Verlaine under the employment of SCI. During the term of this contract, the employer brought Palo to a hospital in Mexico to be medically examined, where Palo was diagnosed with \"Left Lumbociatic, Lumbar Spondilo Artrosis.\" After completing the foregoing contract, SCI immediately hired Palo again as Oiler to board L\/T Cortesia, where he was declared fit to work in his PEME. From the foregoing, SCI knows Palo's pre-existing back condition from his employment onboard M\/S CMA CGM Verlaine. This circumstance should have prompted SCI to examine further Palo's conditions to determine if he is indeed fit to work onboard L\/T Cortesia. An employer is expected to know the physical demands of a seafarer's engagement; it is then equally expected of the employer to peruse the results of the PEME to ensure that, health-wise, its recruits are up to par. Despite knowledge of the seafarer's pre-existing condition, SCI admitted Palo's fit-to-work PEME assessment issued by the company-designated physician for the L\/T Cortesia contract. By accepting the physician's fit-to-work assessment, SCI is bound to that conclusion and its necessary consequences, including, compensating the seafarer for the aggravation of negligently or deliberately overlooked conditions. Clearly, Palo's non-disclosure of the 2001 diagnosis in the PEME for L\/T Cortesia could not have been coupled with intent to deceive as SCI knew of his pre-existing back conditions. In hiring Palo for the L\/T Cortesia contract, SCI takes the seafarer as it finds him and assumes the risk of liability.\nOn that note, We now determine whether or not Palo is entitled to payment of full disability benefits. ℒαwρhi৷ As a rule, award of disability benefits shall be based from the company-designated physician's final assessment. Section 20(B) of the POEA-SEC provides that, to constitute a final assessment, a company designated physician's assessment should declare a seafarer fit to work or the degree of his disability. Further defined, a final, conclusive and definite assessment must clearly state whether the seafarer is fit to work or the exact disability rating, or whether such illness is work-related, and without any further condition or treatment. It should no longer require any further action on the part of the company-designated physician and it is issued by the company-designated physician after he or she has exhausted all possible treatment options within the periods mandated by law. Relatedly, this final assessment shall be issued within 120 days from the date of the seafarer's medical repatriation or within 240 days, if supported with justification for extension of medical treatment. Failure to issue a final assessment within the foregoing periods renders a seafarer's illness or injury permanent and total regardless of justification.\nMoreover, this Court cannot emphasize enough that the company-designated physician is mandated to issue a medical certificate, which should be personally received by the seafarer, or, if not practicable, sent to him\/her by any other means sanctioned by present rules. The seafarer must be fully and properly informed of his medical condition. The results of his\/her medical examinations, the treatments extended to him\/her, the diagnosis and prognosis, if needed, and, of course, his\/her disability grading must be fully explained to him\/her by no less than the company-designated physician. The seafarer must be accorded proper notice and due process especially where his\/her well-being is at stake. The effect of failure of the company to furnish the seafarer a copy of his medical certificate militates gravely against the company's cause.\nHere, We find Palo entitled to payment of full disability benefits for SCI's failure to furnish him the final assessment issued by the company­ designated physician with the Grade 8 rating. On record, Palo consistently claimed at the proceedings before the LA until the CA on his non-receipt of an assessment with a disability rating or a fitness to work certification. He claimed to only having received a certification stating the period of his medical and surgical evaluation for his back conditions, viz :\nDATE: March 19, 2013 FOR SSS\/OWWA PURPOSE ONLY NOT VALID FOR MEDICO-LEGAL USE\nTo Whom it may concern,\nThis is to certify that Mr. Dino S. Palo has undergone medical\/surgical evaluation treatment at Marine Medical Services from October 8, 2012 to Present due to L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 Disc Desiccation; L3-L4 Generalized Disc Bulge; L4-L5, Left Sided Disc Bulge with Romaninal Narrowing; S\/P Laminotomy, For a Minotomy, Disketomy L4-L5, Left; Laminotomy, Foraminotomy LS-S1, Left; S\/P Interspinous Process Decompression using X-Stop L4-L5.\nSIGNED Karen Frances Hao-Quan, M.D.\nA certification stating the period of Palo's medical and surgical treatment does not come close to a final assessment contemplated by the POEA-SEC. ℒαwρhi৷ Palo even claimed that he learned of the Grade 8 assessment only during the conciliation proceedings before the labor tribunals. SCI did not deny failure to furnish the Grade 8 assessment nor that it only issued to Palo a certification on the period of his treatment. While the company-designated physician issued a Grade 8 assessment 164 days from Palo's repatriation or within the 240-day period, there is neither proof nor allegation that Palo had been furnished the same. In fact, SCI mainly anchors its position that Palo is not entitled to payment of full disability benefits for fraudulent misrepresentation. Without furnishing the final assessment to Palo within the mandated 120\/240-day periods, he was not given any opportunity to evaluate his medical assessment. Palo was left guessing the status of his health. As there was no definitive and final assessment from the company-designated physician to contest, procedures for the seafarer to seek the medical opinion of a second physician or even a third physician could not have ensued.\nFinally, the corresponding award of full disability benefits under the POEA-SEC shall be observed instead of the CBA considering that Palo's back condition was not established to have resulted from an accident. An \"accident\" in its commonly accepted meaning, has been defined as a fortuitous circumstance, event, or happening, an event happening without any human agency, or if happening wholly or partly through human agency, an event which under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens. The back pain, which Palo had been experiencing prior employment in L\/T Cortesia, and which worsened when he carried a heavy object, was not an unlooked for mishap, occurrence, or fortuitous event. It did not arise from an unusual circumstance or an accident. Thus, the provisions of the CBA are inapplicable.

EMIA, ARFEL D. DAAN, OMAR G. BAYRON, LUZVINA M. SUMITON, AND WILLIE JAMES A. WONG, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nINTING, J.:\nFor the Court's resolution is the Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Decision dated June 22, 2017 and the Resolution dated January 29, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 07215-MIN which, among others, affirmed the Decision dated September 22, 2015 of the Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman) in OMB-M-A-15-0143. The CA found Loreto S. Andaling (petitioner) guilty of Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, and imposed upon him the penalty of dismissal from the service.\nThe Antecedents\nThe case is rooted on a Joint Complaint-Affidavit dated May 10, 2012 filed by Antonio B. Jumawak, Marina M. Tinonga, Nestor I. Epo, Cornelio R. Tabad, Samuel L. Emia, Arfel D. Daan, Omar G. Bayron, Luzvina M. Sumiton, and Willie James A Wong (collectively, respondents) against petitioner and several others before the Ombudsman. In particular, the case against petitioner; Cipriano E. Plazos (Plazos), Municipal Treasurer; and Urdaneta C. Madridondo (Madridondo), Municipal Accountant was docketed as OMB-M-A-12-0221.\nIn their Joint Complaint-Affidavit, respondents alleged, among others, that petitioner, who, at the time, was an incumbent municipal councilor, had obtained substantial cash advances in the total amount of P80,229. from the Municipal Government of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte in the years 2002, 2005 to 2009 and 2011, and failed to liquidate them within the period specified by law and set by the Commission on Audit (COA). Thus, respondents prayed that a formal criminal and administrative investigation be conducted against petitioner.\nFor his part, petitioner asserted that he had already fully liquidated his cash advances as of July 27, 2012 as evidenced by the Statement of Cash Advances and Liquidations issued by Madridondo. He further explained that the delay in the submission of his liquidation reports was not intentional, but was mere inadvertence on his part.\nIn its Joint-Resolution dated February 14, 2013, the Ombudsman dismissed the complaint without prejudice due to incomplete evidence and endorsed it to the COA for the conduct of a special audit investigation in connection thereto.\nOn March 11, 2015, the COA submitted its Final Evaluation Report dated February 16, 2015 to the Ombudsman. In the report, the COA pointed out, among others, that petitioner and his co-respondents in OMB-M-A-12-0221 had failed to liquidate their cash advances within the period required by law and pertinent rules and regulations. 1aшphi1 Specifically, in petitioner's case, the COA noted that his total cash advances had accumulated to P127,414. for the years 2002 to 2011 before they were fully liquidated by petitioner in 2012.\nOn the basis of the COA's Final Evaluation Report, the Ombudsman redocketed the case against petitioner and his co-respondents therein as OMB-M-A-15-143.\nRuling of the Ombudsman\nIn its Decision dated September 22, 2015, the Ombudsman found petitioner administratively liable for his failure to make certain that his cash advances for local travels had all the necessary supporting documents and to liquidate the cash advances within the prescribed 30-day period pursuant to COA Circular Nos. 94-004, 90-331, and 97-002. It pointed out that petitioner only liquidated his cash advances after the lapse of several years and beyond the period set by the COA Auditor per the Demand Letter dated February 6, 2012.\nThus, the dispositive portion of the Decision states:\nWHEREFORE , premised on all the foregoing, respondents Loreto S. Andaling, Cipriano B. Plazos and Urdaneta C. Madridondo are held administratively guilty of Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and are hereby meted out the penalty of DISMISSAL from the service. Such penalty carries with it the cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office and bar from taking civil service examinations.\nx x x\nSO ORDERED.\nAggrieved, petitioner and his correspondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration or Reinvestigation, but the Ombudsman denied the motion in its Order dated December 18, 2015.\nAs a result, petitioner, along with Plazos, Madridondo, and Patchito T. Eguia (Eguia), who was also administratively charged based on the COA's Final Evaluation Report, elevated the case to the CA via a Petition for Review dated January 21, 2016 under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. In particular, petitioner and Eguia argued, among others, that their reelection operated as a condonation of their alleged misconduct which was supposedly committed during their previous terms.\nRuling of the CA\nThe CA, in its Decision dated June 22, 2017, denied the Petition for Review for lack of merit. It agreed with the Ombudsman that the doctrine of condonation did not apply to Eguia because he was not reelected to the same position that he held at the time the alleged offenses were committed. In petitioner's case, the CA ruled that he had failed to invoke condonation as a defense before the Ombudsman. It further noted that there was nothing on record to show that he was reelected to the same position of municipal councilor.\nUpon the parties' Motion for Reconsideration, the CA amended its earlier ruling, but only insofar as Eguia was concerned. The CA resolved to apply the doctrine of condonation only to Eguia considering that he was reelected during the 2013 and 2016 elections in the Municipality of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte, albeit in a different elective position.\nThe dispositive portion of the Resolution dated January 29, 2018 thus reads:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, Petitioner Patchito T. Eguia's Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED . The Court's 22 June 2017 Decision [is] hereby MODIFIED only with respect to Petitioner Patchito T. Eguia, as follows:\nThat the administrative charges against Petitioner Patchito T. Eguia is ordered DISMISSED considering that the acts charged against him are deemed CONDONED by his reelection.\nThe Motions for Reconsideration filed by petitioners Loreto S. Andaling, Cipriano B. Plazos and Urdaneta C. Madridondo are hereby DENIED for LACK of MERIT.\nSO ORDERED.\nHence, the present petition.\nThe Issues\nPetitioner raises the following issues for the Court's resolution:\nI\nWHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT REFUSED TO APPLY THE DOCTRINE LAID DOWN BY THE SUPREME COURT IN AGUINALDO VS. SANTOS.\nII\nWHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT REFUSED TO ABSOLVE PETITIONER LORETO S. ANDALING FROM ANY ADMINISTRATIVE LIABILITY.\nIII\nWHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT REFUSED TO DECLARE THE PENALTY IMPOSED BY THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN UPON PETITIONERS AS HARSH, CRUEL AND UNREASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.\nPetitioner avers that both the CA and the Ombudsman erred in not applying the condonation doctrine in his favor considering that his reelection operated as a condonation of his previous misconduct. Further, he claimed that his delay in liquidating the cash advances cannot be considered as Grave Misconduct as there is no evidence that his omission had been attended by corruption or the willful intent to violate the law or to disregard established rules.\nIn their Comments, respondents maintained that the Ombudsman and the CA correctly ruled that the doctrine of condonation cannot be applied to petitioner because the records are bereft of any proof that he was reelected to the same position of municipal councilor.\nWhile the case was pending with the Court, petitioner died of hepatic failure on April 14, 2019. Thus, in addition to the above-mentioned issues, the Court will also resolve whether the death of petitioner warrants the dismissal of the present administrative case against him.\nThe Courts Ruling\nAt the outset, it bears emphasis that petitioner has already admitted that he was unable to liquidate his cash advances within the period set by the COA. He mainly argues that his reelection as a Member of the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte operated as a condonation of his previous misconduct pursuant to doctrine laid down in Aguinaldo v. Hon. Santos.\nThe question thus arises: Is the condonation doctrine applicable in petitioner's case notwithstanding its abandonment in the case of Ombudsman Carpio Morales v. CA, et al. ( Carpio Morales )? The answer, however, is a definitive no.\nIn the case of Madreo v. Bayron ( Madreo ), the Court clarified the prospective application of the abandonment of the condonation doctrine in Carpio Morales as follows:\nx x x [T]he Court ruled in Carpio-Morales that the abandonment of the doctrine of condonation is applied prospectively, it meant that the said doctrine does not anymore apply to public officials re-elected after its abandonment. Stated differently, the doctrine still applies to those officials who have been re-elected prior to its abandonment. That is because when a public official had already been re-elected prior to the promulgation and finality of Carpio-Morales, he or she has every right to rely on the old doctrine that his re-election had already served as a condonation of his previous misconduct, thereby cutting the right to remove him from office, and a new doctrine decreeing otherwise would not be applicable against him or her. More telling, once re-elected, the public official already had the vested right not to be removed from office by reason of the condonation doctrine, which cannot be divested or impaired by a new law or a new doctrine without violating the Constitution. x x x\nSimilarly, in the 2021 case of Gaudan v. Degamo (Degamo), the Court, citing the case of Madreo, ruled in no uncertain terms that \"the condonation doctrine is no longer an available defense to a public official who is reelected on or after April 12, 2016. In other words, the reelection of a public official on or after April 12, 2016 would no longer absolve him or her from any administrative liability arising from a previous misconduct that he or she had committed during a prior term.\"\nIn this case, petitioner was reelected as a Member of the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte in the May 2016 elections. While it appears that he ran for a seat as a Provincial Board Member in District II of the Province of Zamboanga del Norte in 2013, there is no conclusive proof on record that he had been successfully elected in the position. On the contrary, petitioner's name is not among those enumerated in the 2013 List of Newly-Elected Officials - Zamboanga del Norte, as provided in the Department of the Interior and Local Government website:\n(see image, p. 8)\nThus, in line with Madreo and Degamo, the Court holds that petitioner's reelection on May 9, 2016, which took place after the abandonment of the condonation doctrine in Carpio Morales attained finality, cannot be deemed to operate as a condonation of previous misconduct that he allegedly committed in the years 2002, 2005 to 2009 and 2011.\nThe Court likewise cannot consider petitioner's reelection as a Member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte in the 2010 elections as a condonation of any misconduct he committed during his two prior terms.\nTo recall, petitioner's original defense in his Counter-Affidavit dated August 22, 2012 was wholly predicated upon the full liquidation of his cash advances as of July 27, 2012. Moreover, the records show that petitioner had raised condonation as a defense for the first time before the CA, which, at the time of filing of the Petition for Review in January 2016, could have only referred to his reelection in 2010. Then, in the present petition, he again cites his reelection as a Member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte, but this time, he offers proof of his reelection on May 9, 2016 per Certification from the Commission on Elections dated February 20, 2018.\nOn this point, it bears stressing that condonation is an \" affirmative fact \" that must be raised at the earliest opportunity, i.e. , during the administrative proceedings before the Ombudsman to enable it to fully consider and pass upon the matter. Here, it is indisputable that petitioner had failed to invoke condonation by virtue of his reelection in 2010 as a defense with the Ombudsman. More than that, he also failed to provide proof of his reelection in 2010 when he raised the matter of condonation before the CA.\nThus, although it is true that petitioner's reelection in 2010 could have possibly operated as a condonation of his purported misconduct in the years 2002 and 2005 to 2009, his failure to invoke it as a defense before the Ombudsman effectively forecloses any consideration of this factual matter in the proceedings before the Court.\nThe Court shall now resolve the issue regarding the effect of petitioner's death during the pendency of the present administrative case against him.\nIn the recent case of Flores-Concepcion v. Judge Castañeda ( Judge Castañeda ), the Court dismissed the administrative case against the respondent judge in view of her death during the pendency of the case. It explained as follows:\nHence, when the respondent in a pending administrative case dies, the case must be rendered moot. Proceeding any further would be to violate the respondent's fundamental right to due process. Should it be a guilty verdict, any monetary penalty imposed on the dead respondent's estate only works to the detriment of their heirs. To continue with such cases would not punish the perpetrator, but only subject the grieving family to further suffering by passing on the punishment to them. (Emphasis supplied.)\nAs it currently stands, the respondent in an administrative case must be given the opportunity not only to be informed of the judgment against him or her, but also to seek reconsideration of that judgment in order to fully satisfy the requirements of due process.\nBecause petitioner has effectively lost the opportunity to be informed and to seek reconsideration of any judgment against him on account of his death on April 14, 2019, or during the pendency of these proceedings, the Court is constrained to dismiss this administrative case on the ground of mootness in accordance with the doctrine laid down in Judge Castañeda. With the dismissal of the case, the Court finds it unnecessary to pass upon the other issues regarding petitioner's administrative liabilities.\nWHEREFORE , the administrative case against petitioner Loreto S. Andaling is hereby DISMISSED in view of his death pending resolution thereof.\nSO ORDERED.\nLeonen (Chairperson), Hernando, Delos Santos, and J. Lopez, JJ., concur.\n","label":[[24,39,"CASE_NUM"],[41,55,"PROM_DATE"],[58,76,"PERSON"],[94,112,"PERSON"],[114,131,"PERSON"],[133,146,"PERSON"],[148,165,"PERSON"],[167,181,"PERSON"],[183,196,"PERSON"],[198,212,"PERSON"],[214,232,"PERSON"],[238,258,"PERSON"],[289,295,"PERSON"],[309,314,"INS"],[461,477,"INS"],[479,481,"INS"],[486,510,"CASE_NUM"],[586,609,"INS"],[611,620,"INS"],[646,648,"INS"],[655,673,"PERSON"],[957,975,"PERSON"],[977,994,"PERSON"],[996,1009,"PERSON"],[1011,1028,"PERSON"],[1030,1044,"PERSON"],[1046,1059,"PERSON"],[1061,1075,"PERSON"],[1077,1095,"PERSON"],[1101,1120,"PERSON"],[1253,1271,"PERSON"],[1273,1278,"PERSON"],[1307,1329,"PERSON"],[1331,1341,"PERSON"],[1798,1817,"INS"],[1819,1822,"INS"],[2430,2433,"INS"],[2529,2532,"INS"],[2632,2635,"INS"],[2884,2887,"INS"],[3056,3059,"INS"],[3510,3513,"INS"],[3687,3690,"INS"],[3854,3872,"PERSON"],[3874,3892,"PERSON"],[3897,3919,"PERSON"],[4551,4557,"PERSON"],[4559,4569,"PERSON"],[4575,4592,"PERSON"],[4594,4599,"PERSON"],[4653,4656,"INS"],[4709,4711,"INS"],[4767,4774,"STA"],[4828,4833,"PERSON"],[5006,5008,"INS"],[5013,5015,"INS"],[5183,5188,"PERSON"],[5327,5329,"INS"],[5587,5589,"INS"],[5638,5643,"PERSON"],[5663,5665,"INS"],[5720,5725,"PERSON"],[6012,6029,"PERSON"],[6159,6176,"PERSON"],[6241,6258,"PERSON"],[6418,6436,"PERSON"],[6438,6456,"PERSON"],[6461,6483,"PERSON"],[6620,6625,"INS"],[7169,7171,"INS"],[7180,7189,"INS"],[7646,7655,"INS"],[7664,7666,"INS"],[7895,7900,"INS"],[8009,8014,"INS"],[8304,8307,"INS"],[8365,8382,"INS"],[8683,8692,"INS"],[8693,8707,"PERSON"],[8724,8738,"PERSON"],[8831,8836,"INS"],[8925,8939,"PERSON"],[8979,8993,"PERSON"],[9407,9421,"PERSON"],[9988,9994,"PERSON"],[9998,10004,"PERSON"],[10006,10012,"PERSON"],[10019,10024,"INS"],[10045,10051,"PERSON"],[10504,10521,"INS"],[11074,11080,"PERSON"],[11085,11091,"PERSON"],[11224,11238,"PERSON"],[11400,11405,"INS"],[11474,11491,"INS"],[11911,11913,"INS"],[12119,12137,"INS"],[12496,12505,"INS"],[12695,12704,"INS"],[12832,12834,"INS"],[13058,13067,"INS"],[13162,13167,"INS"],[13173,13178,"INS"],[13340,13357,"PERSON"],[13385,13394,"PERSON"],[13402,13407,"INS"],[14540,14545,"INS"],[14674,14683,"PERSON"],[14721,14726,"INS"],[14884,14902,"PERSON"],[14984,14990,"PERSON"],[15006,15014,"PERSON"],[15016,15028,"PERSON"],[15034,15043,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nPERALTA, C.J.:\nThis is to resolve the Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, dated March 2, 2016 of Anthony John Apura (Apura) that seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision dated May 29, 2014 of the Court of Appeals (CA), in CA-G.R. CEB CR-HC No. 00873, affirming with modifications the Decision dated April 10, 2007, in CBU-66703 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 20, Cebu City, finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder.\nThe facts follow.\nOn July 18, 2003, the victim, Mark James Enriquez (Enriquez), his cousin Bobit, and Mark Pua were at Unibeersities Resto Bar located at Archbishop Reyes Ave., Cebu City. When Enriquez offered Christian Elly Labay (Labay), a waiter at the same bar, a shot of beer, the latter saw that a man walked behind Enriquez and struck the latter with a bottle on his head. The man who struck Enriquez on the head was later identified by Labay as the petitioner, Apura. Subsequently, Apura stepped aside and three other persons who were with accused Sherwin \"Bungot\" Que (accused Que), struck Enriquez with beer bottles. Thereafter, accused Que approached Enriquez and shot the latter. The gun, however, misfired. On the second attempt, after accused Que turned on his side to fix the gun, Enriquez was hit in the head and fell to the ground. A commotion then followed, with the rest of the customers running. It was then that Apura, accused Que, and the three other companions who struck Enriquez with beer bottles, walked through the big exit towards the gate and into the direction of Grand Convention Center where they boarded a white van with plate number GJM-961.\nThe victim, Enriquez was brought to the hospital and was attended to by Dr. Wyben Briones (Dr. Briones), and the former eventually died, the immediate cause of which was the injuries he sustained from the gunshot wound in the head. In his examination of the victim, Dr. Briones found out that aside from hematoma on the gunshot wound, on the right forehead of the victim, there was a \"lacerated wound surrounded by an area of contusion and the skin was avulsed\" which may have been caused by a blunt object, not a sharp bladed instrument. There was also a fracture on the proximal phalanx at the right hand (4th finger) caused by a penetration of a bullet that went through and through. There was also a metal fragment imbedded in the wound that is too small to be retrieved.\nThus, an Information was filed against Apura, accused Que and their companions, for the crime of Murder, which reads as follows:\nThat on or about the 19th day of July, 2003, at 12:45 A.M., more or less, in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused conniving, confederating, and mutually helping with one another, armed with and (sic) unlicensed handgun, with deliberate intent, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there suddenly and unexpectedly attack, assault and use personal violence upon the person of Mark James Enriquez, by striking him with bottles of beer and shot him with the use of the said unlicensed handgun, hitting him on his head, thereby inflicting upon him injuries, as a consequence of which Mark James S. Enriquez died on July 21, 2003.\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\nApura and his co-accused entered their respective pleas of \"not guilty\" during their arraignment. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.\nThe prosecution presented the testimonies of Christian Elly Labay, a waiter at the bar, Mark Anthony Lapatis (Lapatis), another waiter at the same bar, Jose Wilfredo Cala, a customer at the bar when the incident happened, Dr. Wyben Briones, the victim's attending physician, and Dr. Gil Macato, the one who conducted the autopsy on the victim.\nThe defense presented the testimonies of Apura, accused Que and Hanzel Lauron (Lauron).\nAccording to Apura, on July 18, 2003, he went to Unibeersities Resto Bar through the invitation of a certain Jose Perez (Perez). Apura arrived at the said bar at 10:00 p.m. Around 12:00 a.m. to 12:05 a.m., Perez went out of the bar to buy cigarettes and when he returned, Apura noticed that Perez's lower lip was swollen. Apura asked Perez what happened, and the latter said that \"somebody boxed me outside\". Around 12:30 a.m., Perez blurted, \"Oy, the one who boxed me is here,\" at the same time pointing at someone sitting near the bar about 10 meters from where they were seated. Perez then told him and their companions to accompany him. When petitioner was about one and a one-half (1 1\/2) meters from the man pointed by Perez as his alleged attacker (the victim, in this case), the latter told him \"unsa man\" (What?). Thereafter, the alleged attacker of Perez appeared to be pulling something from his side that looked like a black hunting knife. As such, Apura swung the bottle of beer that he was holding at that time towards Enriquez who was hit in the right temple of his head. At that time, Apura did not know the person he hit. Afraid that the victim's companions might retaliate, Apura claimed that he ran out of the bar and hailed a taxi.\nAccused Que, in his testimony, admitted that he brought a gun with him at the bar. He claimed that a fight erupted at the said bar between a fraternity he is a member of and a rival fraternity. It was during the commotion that he fired his handgun. He misfired the first shot and then fired another aiming at the chest of an attacker. According to him, he did not know if he was able to hit his attackers although he saw them scamper away. He then disposed the firearm in his place. The following morning, he learned that somebody was shot and that the victim was Enriquez. He declared that what happened was an accident and he had no intention of killing the victim. Witness Lauron corroborated the testimony of accused Que.\nThe RTC, on April 10, 2007, promulgated its decision finding Apura and accused Que guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder. The dispositive portion of the said decision reads as follows:\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing this court finds accused SHERWIN QUE GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as a principal in the crime of Murder qualified by treachery and hereby sentences him to suffer reclusion perpetua . The court likewise finds accused ANTHONY JOHN APURA GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as an accomplice, not as a principal, in the crime of Murder qualified by treachery and, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, hereby sentences him to an indeterminate prison term of 6 years and 1 day of prision mayor as minimum, to 14 years 8 months and 1 day of reclusion temporal as maximum.\nBoth accused are also hereby ordered to pay jointly and severally the heirs of Mark James S. Enriquez the sum of [P]50,000. as indemnity ex delicto and [P]50,000. as moral damages, and the costs.\nConsidering that the three other accused have remained at-large, let warrants of arrest issue against them, to be separately tried once, apprehended.\nSO ORDERED.\nPetitioner elevated the case to the CA and the latter court, on May 29, 2014, dismissed the appeal with modifications, thus:\nWHEREFORE , the April 10, 2007 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 20, Cebu City in Criminal Case No. CBU-66703, convicting [accused] Sherwin Que @ Bungot of Murder and sentencing him of reclusion perpetua is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION S. [Apura] is ineligible for parole. Moreover, the accessory penalties are deemed INCLUDED in the principal penalty. [Apura] is ORDERED to pay the heirs of Mark James Enriquez, the amounts of [P]75,000. as civil indemnity, [P]50,000. as moral damages, P30,000. as exemplary damages, [P]4,431,013. as actual damages, 6% interest on all the damages herein awarded from the date of the incident to the finality of the judgment and 12% interest from the finality hereof until fully paid, and to pay costs.\nThe Director of the Bureau of Prisons is ordered to submit a REPORT to this Court within five (5) days, acknowledging receipt of this Decision.\nThe April 10, 2007 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 20, Cebu City in Criminal Case No. CBU-66703, convicting [petitioner] Anthony John Apura as accomplice in the crime of murder is also AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as to the maximum term of his penalty. [Petitioner] Anthony John Apura is penalized to suffer imprisonment for a period of six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as minimum to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum together with the accessory penalties under the law. [Petitioner] Anthony John Apura must pay jointly and solidarily with [accused] Sherwin Que@ Bungot, the heirs of the victim, Mark James Enriquez, the amounts aforestated as his civil liability.\nThe Regional Trial Court is DIRECTED to cancel the bail posted by [petitioner] Anthony John Apura and to issue alias warrants of arrest for the other accused who are still at-large.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe CA rejected accused Que's plea of self-defense because he failed to prove the presence of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, which is an essential element of such plea. The prosecution, according to the CA, was able to prove that all the elements of the crime of murder are present in this case. As to petitioner, the CA ruled that he was an accomplice to the crime of murder as there was unity of purpose with the principal.\nHence, the present petition.\nPetitioner raises the following issues:\nA. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMUTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN, IN VIOLATION OF RECENT LAWS AND JURISPRUDENCE, IT GAVE CREDIT TO THE TESTIMONY OF LAPATIS DURING DIRECT EXAMINATION, DESPITE THE LATTER'S INCONSISTENCIES AND SELF-CONTRADICTIONS;\nB. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT RULED, ON THE BASIS OF LAPATIS' TESTIMONY DURING DIRECT EXAMINATION, THAT THERE IS COMMUNITY OF CRIMINAL DESIGN BETWEEN APURA AND THE GROUP OF QUE AND THAT APURA BY HIS ACTIONS AGREED WITH THE CRIMINAL PURPOSE OF QUE.\nC. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN ITS APPLICATION OF THE LAW RELEVANT TO ACCOMPLICES, AND WHEN IT HELD APURA LIABLE AS AN ACCOMPLICE, NOT SEPARATELY AND INDIVIDUALLY LIABLE FOR PHYSICAL INJURIES;\nD. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT AWARDED ACTUAL DAMAGES INCONSISTENTLY WITH RELEVANT LAWS AND JURISPRUDENCE.\nAccording to Apura, prosecution witness Lapatis is an incredible witness and his testimonies do not deserve any consideration because it is full of inconsistencies and contradictions. He also claims that the prosecution failed to show that there was a community of criminal intent between him and accused Que and the latter's group, that he agreed to the criminal purpose of accused Que and his group and that he cooperated in the accomplishment of the crime. As such, Apura argues that he cannot be held liable as an accomplice because the requisites of which are wanting. He further argues that the cases relied upon by the CA are inapplicable in his case and that he should be held separately and individually liable only for physical injuries. Lastly, he questions the award of damages by stating expenses incurred were not proven with reasonable certainty.\nThe petition is unmeritorious.\nIn order that a person may be considered an accomplice, the following requisites must concur: (1) that there be community of design; that is, knowing the criminal design of the principal by direct participation, he concurs with the latter in his purpose; (2) that he cooperates in the execution by previous or simultaneous act, with the intention of supplying material or moral aid in the execution of the crime in an efficacious way; and (3) that there be a relation between the acts done by the principal and those attributed to the person charged as accomplice.\nA close analysis of the events that took place prior and simultaneous to the crime committed shows that Apura is indeed an accomplice. He struck the victim in the head with a beer bottle, an act that indicates that he cooperated in the execution of the crime by a previous act that is not indispensable in the killing of the victim, but, nevertheless, aided accused Que in pursuing his criminal design. As aptly ruled by the RTC:\nThe evidence shows that Apura struck Enriquez with a beer bottle in the head from behind. In fact, he was the first to assault the victim. Thus, even if he was not a co-conspirator, the incontrovertible fact remains that he did an act which started the chain of events that culminated in the shooting of the victim by Que. By his act of striking Enriquez with a beer bottle in the head, he is deemed by this court to have cooperated in the execution of the offense by a previous act, albeit not indispensable as it was not necessary for him to do it in order that Que could carry out his criminal design to kill Enriquez. This fixes Apura's criminal liability in this case as that of an accomplice in the commission of the offense under Article 18 of the Revised Penal Code and comformably to the ruling of the Supreme Court in People vs. Templonuevo, G.R. No. L-12280, January 30, 1960. Under Article 18, Revised Penal Code, \"(a)ccomplices are those persons who, not being included in Article 17, cooperate in the execution of the offense by previous or simultaneous acts\". In People vs. Templonuevo, where it was shown that appellant struck the deceased on the forehead with a piece of wood, rendering the latter unconscious, thereby facilitating the subsequent slaying of the deceased by appellant's co-accused, the Supreme Court held that said appellant must be deemed responsible as an accomplice in the killing. He cooperated in it by previous or simultaneous acts, albeit non-indispensable ones, as his co-accused could have killed the victim with his bolo even if appellant had not intervened.\nThus, all the elements for one to be an accomplice are present in this case. The cooperation that the law punishes is the assistance knowingly or intentionally rendered that cannot exist without previous cognizance of the criminal act intended to be executed, and the prosecution was able to prove such cooperation. The unity of purpose with that of the accused Que was also proven by the prosecution. The CA, thus, appropriately ruled:\n[Petitioner] Apura's insistence that the ruling in People v. Rustico Tilos and Mateo Mahinay (at-large) is applicable, fails to convince Us. In that case, the Supreme Court noted that of the three prosecution witnesses, only one stated that the attacks of accused-appellant and accused-at-large on the victim immediately followed one another. The Supreme Court observed that the daughter and wife of the victim declared that the accused at-large attacked the victim through fistic blows on the face and nape only after the victim's wife arrived and pulled him (victim) away from accused-appellant. It was the accused-appellant who first inflicted fistic blows on the abdomen of the victim. In the Tilos case, the Supreme Court held that such inconsistency in the sequence of events posed a significant doubt on the unity of purpose between the two accused so that the accused-appellant cannot be considered as an accomplice.\nWe do not find the facts in the Tilos case similar to the instant appeal. Immediately before the victim in this case was shot at the back of his head by appellant Que, he was first struck by [petitioner] Apura in the head using a bottle. The acts occurred in close proximity with each other and after the shooting, [petitioner] Apura was seen leaving the locus criminis with [accused] Que and the others. These circumstances constitute convincing evidence of unity of purpose with the principal (appellant Que) that makes [petitioner] Apura an accomplice.\nAs to the inconsistencies in the testimony of the witness for the prosecution, the Court finds no need to deviate from the findings of both the RTC and the CA, as the said inconsistencies are minor and insignificant and does not affect the credibility of the said witness. As correctly ruled by the CA:\nCaution must be exercised to avoid the sweeping conclusion that [petitioner] Apura was no longer around during the shooting. The Supreme Court in People v. Retuta acceded that it cannot expect absolute uniformity in every detail because witnesses react differently to what they see and hear depending upon their situation and state of mind. In this case, Labay's answer to the question on cross-examination if he saw [petitioner] when the shooting occurred, was \"no more.\" It is a remark which could mean that Labay did not see [petitioner] but not necessarily that [petitioner] was no longer around during the shooting. In the preceding question, Labay's answer was that he did not know where the accused was when the victim was struck again in the head which is about consistent with what he said in the direct examination that he did not know anymore what happened to Mr. Apura after the latter struck Mark James Enriquez.\nAt any rate, Lapatis' account was more specific that [petitioner] Apura stood at the side, after he struck victim with a bottle, and consequently, when the others threw bottles at the [Enriquez] and [accused] Que shot him (victim). [Petitioner] Apura exited the resto bar with them too. On these circumstances, it is reasonable to deduce that [petitioner] Apura knew of the criminal purpose of [accused] Que although his participation as a co-principal is not at all clear. In People v. Samudio, et al., the Supreme Court stressed that the failure of the prosecution to prove the existence of conspiracy does not eliminate criminal liability on the part of the appellant. xxx Where the quantum of proof required to establish conspiracy is lacking, the doubt created as to whether the appellant acted as principal or as an accomplice will always be resolved in favor of the milder form of criminal liability - that of a mere accomplice. Juxtaposing jurisprudence with the evidence at hand, We fail to see any error committed by the trial court when it held that [petitioner] Apura's criminal liability was that of an accomplice only.\nMinor inconsistencies and discrepancies pertaining to trivial matters do not affect the credibility of witnesses. ᇈWᑭHIL Moreover, time and again, the Court has deferred to the trial court's factual findings and evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, especially when affirmed by the CA, in the absence of any clear showing that the trial court overlooked or misconstrued cogent facts and circumstances that would justify altering or revising such findings and evaluation. This is because the trial court's determination proceeds from its first-hand opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses, their conduct and attitude under grilling examination, thereby placing the trial court in the unique position to assess the witnesses' credibility and to appreciate their truthfulness, honesty and candor.\nModifications, however, must be made as to the award of damages. The CA ordered accused Que, as principal to the crime, and herein petitioner, as accomplice, to pay the heirs of the victim, jointly and severally, the amounts of P75,000. as civil indemnity, P30,000. as moral damages, P30,000. as exemplary damages. This is error.\nIn People v. Tampus, et al., the Court ruled that due to the difference in participation of the principal and accomplice, the principal, should be liable for two-thirds of the total amount of the damages and the accomplice should be ordered to pay one-third of the amount. Thus, per the original judgment of the CA, accused Que, as principal, can only be held liable for P50,000. as civil indemnity, P33,333. as moral damages and P20,000. as exemplary damages. While the petitioner, under the same judgment, can only be held liable to pay the amounts of P25,000. as civil indemnity, P16,667. as moral damages and P10,000. as exemplary damages.\nWe further observe, however, that the amounts of moral damages and exemplary damages awarded by the CA are not in conformity with standing jurisprudence. In People v. Jugueta, when the penalty imposed is reclusion perpetua , the amount awarded as civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages shall be P75,000. each. Hence, the awards of moral damages and exemplary damages by the CA appear to be a deficient by P25,000. and P45,000., respectively.\nThe Court, in this case, however, cannot increase the amount of moral and exemplary damages to its full extent under Jugueta. It should be noted that Sherwin Que-who, as principal, is supposed to shoulder two-thirds of the increase-did not join petitioner in the present appeal. Under Section 11(a) of Rule 122 of the Rules of Court, the judgment in this appeal cannot prejudice accused Que. The amount of moral damages and exemplary damages may, therefore, only be increased as to the extent of petitioner's liability i.e., only one-third of the increase allowed under Jugueta. Accordingly, petitioner should be adjudged to pay an additional P8,333. moral damages, and an additional P15,000. exemplary damages.\nAnent the P4,431,013. actual damages awarded, the Court finds merit to the contention of petitioner. The Court has held that only expenses supported by receipts and which appear to have been actually expended in connection with the death of the victims may be allowed. In this case, it appears that the heirs of the victim were not able to substantiate their claims as well as present receipts that are itemized or determined to have been incurred in connection with the death, wake and burial of the victim. Nevertheless, it is proper to award temperate damages in lieu of actual damages since the heirs of the victim suffered a loss but failed to fully substantiate their expenditures. Prevailing jurisprudence now fixes the amount of P50,000. as temperate damages, with the principal, being liable for two-thirds of the amount and the petitioner, as an accomplice, one-third of it. The new award of temperate damages may be enforced against accused Que as the same would benefit him as opposed to the original award of actual damages.\nWHEREFORE , Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 dated March 2, 2016 of petitioner Anthony John Apura is DENIED for lack of merit. ℒαwρhi৷ Consequently, the Decision dated May 29, 2014 of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the Court orders:\n(1) Sherwin Que, as principal, to pay the heirs of the victim P50,000. as civil indemnity, P33,333. as moral damages, P20,000. as exemplary damages and P33,333. as temperate damages.\n(2) Petitioner Anthony John Apura, as an accomplice, to pay the heirs of the victim P25,000. as civil indemnity, P25,000. as moral damages, P25,000. as exemplary damages and P16,667. as temperate damages.\nAll awards shall earn 6% interest per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment.\nSO ORDERED.\nCaguioa, Carandang, Zalameda, and Gaerlan, JJ., concur.","label":[[17,32,"CASE_NUM"],[34,48,"PROM_DATE"],[51,69,"PERSON"],[87,112,"INS"],[142,149,"PERSON"],[220,227,"STA"],[252,270,"PERSON"],[272,277,"PERSON"],[354,370,"INS"],[372,374,"INS"],[380,407,"CASE_NUM"],[493,513,"INS"],[515,518,"INS"],[665,684,"PERSON"],[686,694,"PERSON"],[708,713,"PERSON"],[719,727,"PERSON"],[810,818,"PERSON"],[827,848,"PERSON"],[849,854,"PERSON"],[939,947,"PERSON"],[1016,1024,"PERSON"],[1061,1066,"PERSON"],[1086,1091,"PERSON"],[1107,1112,"PERSON"],[1173,1194,"PERSON"],[1216,1224,"PERSON"],[1264,1267,"PERSON"],[1279,1287,"PERSON"],[1374,1377,"PERSON"],[1413,1421,"PERSON"],[1550,1555,"PERSON"],[1565,1568,"PERSON"],[1612,1620,"PERSON"],[1805,1813,"PERSON"],[1869,1882,"PERSON"],[1884,1895,"PERSON"],[2063,2070,"PERSON"],[2608,2613,"PERSON"],[2623,2626,"PERSON"],[3380,3402,"PERSON"],[3443,3448,"PERSON"],[3626,3646,"PERSON"],[3669,3689,"PERSON"],[3691,3698,"PERSON"],[3733,3751,"PERSON"],[3807,3820,"PERSON"],[3864,3874,"PERSON"],[3966,3971,"PERSON"],[3981,3984,"PERSON"],[3989,4002,"PERSON"],[4004,4010,"PERSON"],[4026,4031,"PERSON"],[4122,4132,"PERSON"],[4134,4139,"PERSON"],[4142,4147,"PERSON"],[4219,4224,"PERSON"],[4285,4290,"PERSON"],[4304,4311,"PERSON"],[4335,4340,"PERSON"],[4347,4352,"PERSON"],[4441,4446,"PERSON"],[4595,4600,"PERSON"],[4738,4743,"PERSON"],[4872,4877,"PERSON"],[4974,4979,"PERSON"],[5046,5054,"PERSON"],[5114,5119,"PERSON"],[5205,5210,"PERSON"],[5273,5276,"PERSON"],[5829,5837,"PERSON"],[5941,5947,"PERSON"],[5986,5989,"PERSON"],[5995,5998,"INS"],[6052,6057,"PERSON"],[6070,6073,"PERSON"],[6254,6265,"PERSON"],[6447,6465,"PERSON"],[6874,6896,"PERSON"],[7189,7191,"INS"],[7325,7345,"INS"],[7371,7398,"CASE_NUM"],[7421,7432,"PERSON"],[7527,7532,"PERSON"],[7641,7646,"PERSON"],[7679,7698,"PERSON"],[8204,8224,"INS"],[8250,8277,"CASE_NUM"],[8303,8321,"PERSON"],[8446,8464,"PERSON"],[8712,8729,"PERSON"],[8777,8788,"PERSON"],[8823,8842,"PERSON"],[8896,8916,"INS"],[8971,8989,"PERSON"],[9090,9092,"INS"],[9110,9113,"PERSON"],[9305,9307,"INS"],[9420,9422,"INS"],[9620,9635,"INS"],[9922,9938,"INS"],[10147,10152,"PERSON"],[10170,10173,"PERSON"],[10183,10188,"PERSON"],[10240,10243,"PERSON"],[10267,10283,"INS"],[10436,10441,"PERSON"],[10551,10567,"INS"],[10745,10750,"PERSON"],[10772,10779,"PERSON"],[11037,11040,"PERSON"],[11115,11118,"PERSON"],[11201,11206,"PERSON"],[11358,11360,"PERSON"],[12294,12299,"PERSON"],[12556,12559,"PERSON"],[12615,12618,"INS"],[12644,12649,"PERSON"],[12657,12665,"PERSON"],[12938,12941,"PERSON"],[12966,12974,"PERSON"],[13184,13187,"PERSON"],[13232,13240,"PERSON"],[13253,13259,"PERSON"],[13357,13367,"STA"],[13472,13488,"CASE_NUM"],[13514,13524,"STA"],[13606,13616,"STA"],[13939,13952,"INS"],[14584,14587,"PERSON"],[14628,14630,"INS"],[14672,14677,"PERSON"],[14720,14733,"PERSON"],[14738,14751,"PERSON"],[15006,15019,"INS"],[15372,15385,"INS"],[15616,15621,"PERSON"],[15747,15750,"PERSON"],[15788,15793,"PERSON"],[15912,15917,"PERSON"],[15969,15972,"PERSON"],[16090,16093,"PERSON"],[16119,16124,"PERSON"],[16284,16287,"INS"],[16296,16298,"INS"],[16439,16441,"INS"],[16520,16525,"PERSON"],[16572,16585,"INS"],[16798,16803,"PERSON"],[16953,16958,"PERSON"],[17091,17096,"PERSON"],[17318,17323,"PERSON"],[17348,17367,"PERSON"],[17382,17389,"PERSON"],[17435,17440,"PERSON"],[17554,17562,"PERSON"],[17578,17581,"PERSON"],[17614,17619,"PERSON"],[17725,17730,"PERSON"],[17773,17776,"PERSON"],[17877,17890,"PERSON"],[18443,18449,"PERSON"],[18653,18658,"INS"],[18790,18792,"INS"],[19384,19386,"INS"],[19403,19406,"INS"],[19678,19683,"INS"],[19957,19959,"INS"],[19969,19973,"PERSON"],[20389,20391,"INS"],[20677,20679,"INS"],[20749,20755,"INS"],[20895,20906,"PERSON"],[21030,21043,"STA"],[21047,21055,"STA"],[21132,21135,"PERSON"],[21507,21512,"INS"],[21562,21567,"INS"],[22409,22412,"PERSON"],[22547,22554,"STA"],[22589,22607,"PERSON"],[22775,22786,"PERSON"],[22969,22987,"PERSON"],[23278,23285,"PERSON"],[23287,23296,"PERSON"],[23298,23306,"PERSON"],[23312,23319,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

Garcia, Officer-in-Charge, Regional Director (RD) of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Revenue Region No. 4, issued Letter of Authority No. 000-7465 authorizing, the examination of the books of accounts and other accounting records of the internal revenue taxes of Universal Weavers Corporation (petitioner) for the period covering January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006.\nOn December 6, 2007, Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 20 requested certain documents and records from petitioner and thereafter issued Notices for Informal Conference.\nPetitioner executed several notarized waivers of the statute of limitations to extend the prescriptive period of assessment for internal revenue taxes due in taxable year ending December 31, 2006.\nOn September 16, 2009, Anita P. Sabado (Sabado), petitioner's Assistant Vice-President-Plant Controller, executed the first waiver, but the same did not specify a definite date within which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) may assess petitioner's tax liability.\nOn November 5, 2010, Wilfrido C. Rodriguez, petitioner's Director, executed the second waiver, extending the period of assessment of taxes until December 31, 2011.\nOn August 12, 2010, the RD of Revenue Region No. 4 issued a Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN), assessing petitioner of deficiency income tax, expanded withholding tax, and documentary stamp tax for the taxable year 2006. ℒαwρhi৷ Petitioner received the PAN on September 9, 2011.\nIn a letter dated September 23, 2011, petitioner filed its administrative protest on the PAN and further requested for the immediate reinvestigation and\/or reconsideration thereof.\nOn October 18, 2011, Sabado executed the third waiver, extending the period of assessment of taxes until December 31, 2012.\nOn January 13, 2012, petitioner received the Formal Letter of Demand dated January 3, 2012 with attached assessment notices from the BIR for its alleged deficiency taxes.\nOn February 10, 2012, petitioner filed its protest against the Formal Letter of Demand and submitted its supporting documents on April 10, 2012.\nOn November 5, 2012, petitioner filed a Petition for Review before the CTA.\nThe Ruling of the CTA First Division\nOn May 11, 2015, the CTA First Division rendered a Decision with the dispositive portion as follows:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the Petition for Review is hereby GRANTED . Accordingly, the Final Demand and Final Assessment Notice No. 020-0704010876 is hereby ordered CANCELLED.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe CTA First Division recognized the following defects m the waivers:\n1. The agreed date between the BIR and the petitioner, within which the former may assess and collect revenue taxes, the date of execution of the waiver, and the date of BIR's acceptance were not specified in the first waiver;\n2. The date when Revenue District Officer, Atty. Abencio T. Torres, accepted the waiver was not indicated in the second waiver; and\n3. The date when Revenue District Officer, Roberto S. Bucoy, accepted the waiver was not provided in the third waiver.\nThe CIR filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the same was denied in a Resolution dated August 10, 2015. The fallo of the Resolution reads:\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, [CIR's] Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Decision dated 11 May 2015) is DENIED for lack of merit.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe Ruling of the CTA En Banc\nOn February 9, 2017, the CTA En Banc rendered a Decision, with the dispositive pm1ion as follows:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the Petition for Review is GRANTED . Accordingly, the Decision promulgated on May 11, 2015 and the Resolution promulgated on August 10, 2015 are hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE .\nLet this case be remanded to the Court in Division for further proceedings to determine and rule on the merits of [petitioner's] petition in seeking nullification of the FLO and Assessment Notices dated January 3, 2012.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe CTA En Banc followed the Court's ruling in the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Next Mobile, Inc. and declared that the waivers executed by petitioner cannot be invalidated. It held that even if there was noncompliance with the provisions of BIR Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 20-90 and Revenue Delegation Administrative Order (RDAO) No. 05-01, petitioner was already estopped from claiming that the three waivers are invalid and that the CIR's right to assess has prescribed because of petitioner's acts that persuaded the BIR to postpone the issuance of the assessments.\nThe CTA En Banc opined that both petitioner and the CIR were at fault and accountable for the defects in the three waivers since they continued to transact with each other despite such infirmities. It noted that petitioner persuaded the BIR to delay the issuance of the assessment by executing the invalid waivers. Meanwhile, the BIR was negligent in complying with the requirements of valid waivers as provided in the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) and the existing rules and regulations. Further, petitioner did not question the validity of the waivers and the running of the prescriptive period for the assessment of their deficiency taxes in its protest letter filed before the BIR and in its petition before the CTA First Division.\nThe CTA En Banc concluded that the application of estoppel is necessary to prevent undue injury to the government because of the cancellation of the assessment of the petitioner's deficiency taxes.\nPetitioner moved for the reconsideration of the February 9, 2017 Decision of the CTA En Banc. However, the same was denied in a Resolution dated August 31, 2017, with the dispositive portion as follows:\nWHEREFORE , no compelling reason to reverse the ruling of the Court in the Assailed decision, the [petitioner's] \"Motion for Reconsideration\" is DENIED for lack of merit.\nSO ORDERED.\nHence, the instant petition.\nThe Arguments of the Parties\nPetitioner argues that the CIR's right to assess has already prescribed considering that the first waiver failed to comply with RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO No. 05-01. It avers that the CIR cannot heavily rely on Next Mobile and claim the parties to be equally at fault since it is the duty of the BIR to indicate the date of acceptance of the waiver. It claims that it should not be penalized for the negligence of the BIR, which failed to ensure that all the requirements for a valid waiver were met. Finally, petitioner submits that it is not precluded from raising the invalidity of the waivers pursuant to Section 1, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court.\nThe CIR, through the Office of the Solicitor General, asserts that the execution of the second and third waivers effectively cured or ratified any formal defect on the waiver previously executed. It counters that, assuming for the sake of argument that the waivers were indeed defective, the infirmities should not prejudice the interest of the government when it was most probably a mere inadvertence on the part of the revenue officer, who should have indicated the relevant details. It further points out that both parties continued dealing with each other on the strength of these waivers, without bothering to cure the infirmities extant in the documents. Worse, petitioner did not even question the validity of the waivers. The CIR maintains that it would be the height of injustice on the part of the government if the waiver would be invalidated after petitioner had benefitted from the extension of time granted to submit supporting documents required in the investigation of its internal revenue tax liabilities.\nThe Issue\nWhether or not the CIR's right to assess the deficiency taxes of petitioner has already prescribed.\nThe Court's Ruling\nThe petition is meritorious.\nThe prescriptive period for assessment and collection of internal revenue taxes is governed by Section 203 of the 1997 NIRC. The said provision limits the BIR's authority to assess within three years after the last day prescribed by law for the filing of the return or from the day the return was filed, whichever comes later. Upon the lapse of this period, the assessment issued shall no longer be valid and effective as it is already time-barred.\nThe period to assess and collect deficiency taxes may be extended upon the execution of a valid waiver before the expiration of the original three-year prescriptive period. The CIR and the taxpayer shall execute a written agreement to extend the original period of assessment in accordance with Section 222(b) of the NIRC. The period so agreed upon may be further extended by a subsequent written agreement provided the same is made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.\nIn Philippine Journalists, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Court enunciated that \"a waiver of the statute of limitations under the NIRC, to a certain extent, is a derogation of the taxpayers' right to security against prolonged and unscrupulous investigations\" conducted by revenue officers. Make no mistake, it is not a renunciation of the right to invoke the defense of prescription. \"It is an agreement between the taxpayer and the BIR that the period to issue an assessment and collect the taxes due is extended to a date certain.\" It is, therefore, imperative that the waiver is carefully and strictly construed and duly compliant with the preset guidelines and procedural requirements prescribed by the BIR to serve its purpose of affording protection to the taxpayer.\nTo guide the revenue officers and the taxpayers in the proper execution of the waiver of the statute of limitations, RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO No. 05-01 were issued on April 4, 1990 and August 2, 2001, respectively. The revenue orders require that:\n1. The waiver must be in the form specified in RMO No. 20-90.\n2. The phrase \"but not after ______________19 _____\" should be filled out as it indicates the expiry date of the period agreed upon to assess\/collect the tax after the regular three-year period of prescription.\nThe period agreed upon shall constitute the time within which to effect the assessment\/collection of the tax in addition to the ordinary prescriptive period.\n3. The waiver shall be signed by:\na. the taxpayer themselves or their duly authorized representative, or, in the case of a corporation, its responsible officials; and\nb. the CIR or the revenue official authorized by them, indicating that the BIR has accepted and agreed to the waiver.\nThe date of the BIR's acceptance should be indicated in the waiver.\nThe waiver shall be signed by the revenue officials authorized under RDAO No. 05-01.\n4. The date of execution of the waiver by the taxpayer and date of BIR's acceptance should be before the expiration of the period of prescription or before the lapse of the period agreed upon in case a subsequent agreement is executed.\n5. The waiver should be duly notarized.\n6. The waiver must be executed in three copies, namely, the original copy to be attached to the docket of the case, the second copy for the taxpayer, and the third copy for the office accepting the waiver.\nThe fact of receipt by the taxpayer of their file copy shall be indicated in the original copy.\n7. The foregoing procedures shall be strictly followed.\nFaithful compliance with the provisions of RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO 05-01 is enjoined to accord legal and binding effect to the waiver of statute of limitations.\nHere, all three waivers were not in accordance with the requisites of RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO No. 05-01.\nThe first waiver did not reflect the agreed date within which the BIR may assess and collect taxes. RMO No. 20-90 explicitly states that the phrase \"but not after ___________ 19____\" should be filled out. Petitioner's failure to accurately state such material date logically implies that the first waiver is one of indefinite duration, in violation of Section 222(b) of the NIRC. Furthermore, the first waiver did not specify the date of execution of the agreement, which is necessary to determine whether the waiver was made well-within the period of prescription. Petitioner's blunders in the accomplishment of the first waiver were too glaring to miss, yet the CIR still accepted the same without question. Thus, when the original three-year prescriptive period has lapsed, there was nothing more to extend and the execution of the second waiver was no longer necessary. There being no assessment having been issued, prescription has already set in.\nIt is likewise noteworthy to mention that the waivers executed by petitioner were tainted with a common fatal flaw, that is, the absence of the date of acceptance of the CIR or their authorized revenue officials. The Court has explained in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. FMF Development Corp. that the date of acceptance of the CIR must reflect in the waiver to determine whether it was validly accepted before the expiration of the original period or the period agreed upon in a subsequent waiver. Interestingly, this requirement has been completely disregarded by the CIR in all three occasions. They were remiss in their duty to exact compliance with RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO No. 05-01 and follow the mandates of these issuances.\nThe fact that RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO No. 05-01 require that they be strictly complied with underscores the mandatory nature of the procedural guidelines. They cannot be dispensed with or disregarded since \"failure to fulfill any of the requisites renders a waiver defective and ineffectual.\" Consequently, the period to assess the tax liabilities is deemed never to have been extended and the government ultimately loses its right to enforce collection on the ground of prescription.\nThe CIR invokes the oft-repeated principle that taxes are the lifeblood of the government and contends that the equitable principles of in pari delicto, unclean hands, and estoppel should be applied to sustain the validity of defective waivers, citing as a basis the Court's ruling in Next Mobile. In said case, the taxpayer, after deliberately executing five waivers, insisted on their invalidity due to the following defects: (1) the waivers were signed by an employee without any notarized written authority from the Board of Directors; (2) the dates of the acceptance by the Revenue District Officer were not indicated in the waivers; and (3) the fact of receipt by the taxpayer of its copy of the second waiver was not indicated on the face of the original second waiver. The Court therein reiterated the general rule that failure to comply with the requirements of RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO No. 05-01 renders the waiver invalid and ineffective. However, we also found sufficient reasons to uphold the validity of the defective waivers in Next Mobile due to its peculiar circumstances, viz .:\nFirst, the parties in this case are in pari delicto or \"in equal fault.\" In pari delicto connotes that the two parties to a controversy are equally culpable or guilty and they shall have no action against each other. However, although the parties are in pari delicto, the Court may interfere and grant relief at the suit of one of them, where public policy requires its intervention, even though the result may be that a benefit will be derived by one party who is in equal guilt with the other.\nHere, to uphold the validity of the Waivers would be consistent with the public policy embodied in the principle that taxes are the lifeblood of the government, and their prompt and certain availability is an imperious need. Taxes are the nation's lifeblood through which government agencies continue to operate and which the State discharges its functions for the welfare of its constituents. As between the parties, it would be more equitable if petitioner's lapses were allowed to pass and consequently uphold the Waivers in order to support this principle and public policy.\nSecond, the Court has repeatedly pronounced that parties must come to court with clean hands. ℒαwρhi৷ Parties who do not come to court with clean hands cannot be allowed to benefit from their own wrongdoing. Following the foregoing principle, [the taxpayer] should not be allowed to benefit from the flaws in its own Waivers and successfully insist on their invalidity in order to evade its responsibility to pay taxes.\nThird, respondent is estopped from questioning the validity of its Waivers. While it is true that the Court has repeatedly held that the doctrine of estoppel must be sparingly applied as an exception to the statute of limitations for assessment of taxes, the Court finds that the application of the doctrine is justified in this case. Verily, the application of estoppel in this case would promote the administration of the law, prevent injustice and avert the accomplishment of a wrong and undue advantage. Respondent executed five Waivers and delivered them to petitioner, one after the other. It allowed petitioner to rely on them and did not raise any objection against their validity until petitioner assessed taxes and penalties against it. Moreover, the application of estoppel is necessary to prevent the undue injury that the government would suffer because of the cancellation of petitioner's assessment of respondent's tax liabilities.\nFinally, the Court cannot tolerate this highly suspicious situation. In this case, the taxpayer, on the one hand, after voluntarily executing waivers, insisted on their invalidity by raising the very same defects it caused. On the other hand, the BIR miserably failed to exact from respondent compliance with its rules. The BIR's negligence in the performance of its duties was so gross that it amounted to malice and bad faith. Moreover, the BIR was so lax such that it seemed that it consented to the mistakes in the Waivers. Such a situation is dangerous and open to abuse by unscrupulous tax payers who intend to escape their responsibility to pay taxes by mere expedient of hiding behind technicalities.\nIt i s true that petitioner was also at fault here because it was careless in complying with the requirements of RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO [05-01 . Nevertheless, petitioner's negligence may be addressed by enforcing the provisions imposing administrative liabilities upon the officers responsible for these errors. The BIR's right to assess and collect taxes should not be jeopardized merely because of the mistakes and lapses of its officers, especially in cases like this where the tax payer is obviously in bad faith. (Emphases supplied; citations omitted)\nIn contrast with Next Mobile, only the first waiver in the present case was replete with defects attributable to both petitioner and the BIR. The first waiver was not properly executed on September 16, 2009 as it did not contain the agreed date within which the BIR may assess and collect taxes and the date of acceptance by the CIR. The first waiver could not have effectively extended the three-year prescriptive period to assess and collect taxes for the taxable year 2006. Even if we recognize the doctrine of estoppel and uphold the first waiver because the parties were in pari delicto, the second waiver did not toll the prescriptive period because of the failure to affix the date of acceptance of the second waiver - a mistake solely on the BIR's part. Similarly, the date of acceptance by the CIR was absent in the third waiver executed on October 18, 2010. Thus, even assuming that the first and second waivers were validly executed, the third waiver still resulted in the non-extension of the period to assess or collect taxes since its execution was contrary to the procedural guidelines in RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO No. 05-01.\nEqually telling, there is no justification for the application of the doctrine of estoppel as an exception to the statute of limitations on the assessment of taxes in light of the detailed procedure for the proper execution of the waiver, which the BIR must strictly follow. There is nothing vague nor difficult to understand about the procedural guidelines. The CIR and the revenue officials knew fully well the drastic consequences of noncompliance with RMO No. 20-90 and RDAO No. 05-01, yet they utterly failed to faithfully follow these BIR issuances. Clearly, the BIR is not entitled to the mantle of protection accorded by the doctrine of estoppel. Having caused the defects in the waivers, the BIR must bear the consequence of its own negligence.\nGiven that Next Mobile is of a different factual milieu, the equitable principles of in pari delicto, unclean hands, and estoppel cannot be properly applied to herein case. In all, having established that petitioner's defective waivers of the statute of limitations did not suspend the three-year prescriptive period to issue an assessment, we hold that the right of the government to assess or collect the alleged deficiency taxes in this case is already barred by prescription.\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the Petition for Review on Certiorari of petitioner Universal Weavers Corporation and REVERSES and SETS ASIDE the Decision dated February 9, 2017 and the Resolution dated August 31, 2017 of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc in CTA EB No. 1348.

It is sufficient that there is a reasonable linkage between the disease suffered by the employee and his work to lead a rational mind to conclude that his work may have contributed to the establishment or, at the very least, aggravation of any pre-existing condition he might have had.\"\nThis is to resolve the Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, dated May 9, 2018, of petitioners Virjen Shipping Corporation, JX Ocean Co., Ltd. and\/or C\/E Joseph Alvin S. Olabre seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision dated November 16, 2017 and the Resolution dated March 15, 2018, both of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 149457.\nThe factual antecedents are as follows:\nPrivate respondent, Manuel G. Noblefranca (Noblefranca), had worked for petitioner local manning agent Virjen Shipping Corporation, for and on behalf of its foreign principal, petitioner JX Ocean Co. Ltd., for 23 years. He was initially hired as an ordinary seaman on October 24, 1991, and was promoted to an able seaman on April 26, 1993. He then became a pump man on April 14, 2003, and continued to work as such. His latest contract with petitioner was executed on November 26, 2014 for a nine (9)­ month contract as pump man on board M.T. Eneos Ocean and with a monthly basic salary of US$649.. He boarded the said vessel on December 21, 2014, after being declared \"fit to work\" following the required pre-employment medical examination (PEME) conducted in October 2014.\nAs a pump man, Noblefranca had the responsibility of ensuring the safe and proper operation of the liquid cargo transfer system. He had to monitor, repair, and maintain all the pumps, fittings, valves, and other parts necessarily related to the said system, which work likewise entailed repacking valves and glands, as well as lubricating parts and bearings. Aside from that, he was required to be proficient in shipboard engineering casualty drills, fire drills, and collision drills, as he was expected to take the initiative in emergency situations with specific orders or instructions. He regularly worked for eight to 16 hours a day, and was on call even during his hours of rest to make certain that the vessel is seaworthy and that the voyage would be safe.\nOn March 21, 2015, Noblefranca reported for duty at around 8:30 in the morning to conduct maintenance at the engine room inasmuch as the main valve and fittings required reconditioning. At around 10:30 in the morning, he attended to his personal needs and was surprised when he urinated blood. He was first treated on board, but was later brought to Kawasaki Rinko Hospital on March 31, 2015, where he underwent a Computerized Tomography (CT) Scan of his abdomen. It was then discovered that he had an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. Thereafter, he was repatriated on April 2, 2015, and was admitted at the Manila Medical Center. On April 20, 2015, he was transferred to the Philippine Heart Center where the delicate surgical operation was done. Thereafter, he was re-admitted at the Manila Medical Center on April 30, 2015 and was finally discharged on May 12, 2015.\nNoblefranca continued to take medication and to regularly see the company-designated physician for check-up until the latter terminated his treatment on October 19, 2015. Noblefranca lamented that no final disability assessment was issued to him, and sadly, petitioners refused to provide further medical assistance. Noblefranca pleaded petitioners for aid, in consideration of his 23 years of continuous and efficient service, but the latter turned down his request. He sought a second opinion from Dr. May S. Donato-Tan (Dr. Donato-Tan) concerning his illness. The diagnosis, however, was that he is permanently unfit for sea duties. Hence, Noblefranca filed a complaint to claim disability benefits under the IMMAJ­JSU\/PSU-IBF Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which, as stated in his Contract of Employment, covered his tenure.\nTo refute the complaint, petitioners averred that the company­-designated physician, Dr. Nicomedes G. Cruz (Dr. Cruz), opined in a medical report dated April 7, 2015 that \"[a]bdominal aortic aneurysm is a bulge or dilatation in the wall of the aorta that passes through the abdomen. It tends to run in families and to occur in people who have high blood pressure, especially those who smoke. It is not work-related.\" This was issued long before the 120-day period expired.\nPetitioners likewise pointed out that they shouldered the medical expenses of Noblefranca from the time he was examined at Kawasaki Rinko Hospital in Japan up to his aortic surgical operation and succeeding treatments in the Philippines. They also argued that the IMMAJ-JSU\/PSU­IBF CBA cannot apply, since Noblefranca failed to prove that his contract was covered thereby.\nLabor Arbiter's Ruling\nOn April 19, 2016, Labor Arbiter (LA) Jesus Orlando M. Quinones rendered a Decision in favor of herein petitioners and upheld the diagnosis of Dr. Cruz that the illness suffered by Noblefranca is not work-related. Moreover, no disability grading was provided by either Dr. Cruz or Dr. Donato-Tan; hence, a finding that Noblefranca is suffering from Grade 1 disability cannot be sustained. Noblefranca was likewise faulted for failing to secure a third opinion from a different physician.\nThe dispositive portion of the Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE , the foregoing premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING the complaint for lack of merit.\nLikewise, all other claims are DISMISSED .\nSO ORDERED.\nAggrieved by the LA's Decision, Noblefranca elevated the case to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for review.\nNLRC Ruling\nOn August 24, 2016, the NLRC issued a Decision dismissing Noblefranca's appeal and affirming in toto the Decision of the LA. The dispositive portion reads as follows:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby dismissed for lack of merit. The Labor Arbiter's Decision dated April 29, 2015 is hereby AFFIRMED .\nSO ORDERED.\nOn October 6, 2016, petitioners received Noblefranca's motion for reconsideration.\nOn October 26, 2016, the NLRC issued a Resolution denying Noblefranca's motion for reconsideration, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nActing on the Motion for Reconsideration filed by complainant dated September 23, 2016, relative to the Decision of the Commission dated August 24, 2016, We resolve to DENY the same as the motion raised no new matters of substance which would warrant reconsideration of the Decision of this Commission.\nSO ORDERED.\nThus, Noblefranca elevated the matter to the CA via a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court which was docketed as CA­G.R. SP No. 149457.\nIn his petition, Noblefranca argued that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in its findings that the company-designated physician is tasked under the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) in assessing the seaman's disability. He also averred that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in its findings that his illness is not work-related.\nCA Ruling\nIn a Decision dated November 16, 2017, the CA granted the petition, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED . The Decision dated 24 August 2016 and the Resolution dated 26 October 2016 of the National Labor Relations Commission are ANNULED and SET ASIDE . Private respondents Virjen Shipping Corporation and\/or JX Ocean Co., Ltd. are ORDERED TO PAY petitioner Manuel G. Noblefranca total and permanent disability benefits equivalent to the amount of Sixty Thousand Dollars (US$60,000.) or its peso equivalent at the time of payment, with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe CA ruled that refusal to pay disability benefits on the basis of a mere statement by the company-designated physician that the illness is not work-related is unavailing. Although the company-designated physician is tasked with assessing the illness of a seafarer and the degree of his or her disability, such assessment is neither conclusive nor final and thus, cannot bind the courts which must still weigh the merit of the same as against the factual milieu of the case. The CA opined that in this instant case, it is undeniable that Noblefranca had worked for petitioners for 23 long years. He endured the physical hardships entailed by his tasks as an able bodied seaman for about 12 years, before working as a pump man for 11 more years. Any kind of work or labor ordinarily stresses and strains the physical body resulting in wear and tear of the muscles and organs. However, as a seafarer, Noblefranca had to suffer a great degree of emotional strain as well, fighting off homesickness while being subjected to the perils of the sea. It is not surprising then that Noblefranca's illness developed or, at the very least, was affected by his employment as a seafarer.\nOn December 12, 2017, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration but it was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated March 15, 2018.\nHence, this Petition raising the following arguments:\nI.\nThe Court of Appeals acted on a gross miscomprehension of facts which resulted in the misapplication of law and existing jurisprudence thereby reaching legal conclusions that are not only contrary to the facts conclusively established by uncontroverted evidence on record, but also manifestly mistaken, absurd and impossible, based as they were on speculations, surmises and conjectures when it annulled and set aside the factual determination of BOTH the Labor Arbiter and the illness of the [Noblefranca], ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM, is NOT WORK-­RELATED.\nII.\nThe Court of Appeal s acted on a gross miscomprehension of facts which resulted in the misapplication of law and existing jurisprudence thereby reaching legal conclusions that are not only contrary to the facts conclusively established by uncontroverted evidence on record, but also manifestly mistaken, absurd and impossible, based as they were on speculations, surmises and conjectures when it disregarded the medical reports of the company-designated physician which unequivocally stated that the illness of the private respondent is NOT WORK-RELATED.\nIII.\nThe award of US$60,000. cannot be sustained without any substantial evidence to prove that the private respondent is suffering from a GRADE 1 DISABILITY or even a WORK-RELATED ONE.\nIV\nThe mere fact that an illness which lasted for more than 120 days equates to a WORK-RELATED and GRADE 1 DISABILITY without any medical evidence to support the same cannot be used as legal basis for awarding full disability benefits under the POEA Contract.\nThe Court's Ruling\nThe fundamental issue for this Court's resolution is whether the CA erred in reversing the findings and rulings of the labor tribunals which denied the disability claims of Noblefranca for failing to prove that his illness was work-related.\nAs explained by the Court in Republic v. Martinez:\nIt is settled that under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari before this Court as we are not a trier of facts. Our jurisdiction in such a proceeding is limited to reviewing only errors of law that may have been committed by the lower courts. It is not the function of the Court to reexamine or reevaluate evidence, whether testimonial or documentary, adduced by the parties in the proceedings below.\nFactual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, however, including labor tribunals, are accorded much respect by this Court as they are specialized to rule on matters falling within their jurisdiction especially when these are supported by substantial evidence. The rule, however, is not ironclad and a departure therefrom may be warranted when at least one of these exceptions exist, to wit: \"1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; 2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; 4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; 6) when in making its findings the CA went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; 7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; 8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; 9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; 10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and, 11) when the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.\" Thus, where the findings of fact of the CA are contrary to the findings and conclusions of the trial court or quasi-judicial agency, as in this case, this Court is constrained to review and resolve the factual issue in order to settle the controversy.\nThe present case before us involves the contention of petitioners Virgen Shipping Corporation, JX Ocean Co., Ltd. against the decision of the CA awarding US$60,000. as disability benefits plus 6% interest per annum to Noblefranca as compensation for his work-related illness.\nIn their Petition, petitioners maintain that the illness of Noblefranca was not work-related as diagnosed by the company physician. Petitioners insist that contrary to the findings of the CA, mere lapse of 120\/240 days and\/or the mere allegation of loss of earning capacity should not be the sole basis in awarding benefits without any substantial evidence to support the same. Petitioners also emphasize that factual findings of both the LA and NLRC should be given great weight and must be binding, especially that both the LA and NLRC have arrived at the same conclusion that Noblefranca's illness is not work-related as correctly determined by the company-designated physician whose medical findings should be upheld. Also, the award of US$60,000. cannot be sustained without any substantial evidence to prove that Noblefranca is suffering from a Grade 1 Disability or even a work-related one. Lastly, petitioners contest the award of 6% interest per annum , arguing that the award of 6% interest per annum without being raised on appeal before the LA and the NLRC constitutes a violation of their right to due process and the principle of immutability of final judgements.\nIn his Comment, Noblefranca emphasizes that he worked for petitioners for 23 years, wherein he was exposed to various elements, chemicals, stress, and fatigue. His said employment could have contributed to his illness, as his physical stamina and resistance could have weakened due to the work risks and hazards, and eventually caused him to suffer the same. Thus, contrary to petitioners' claim, his illness, Aortic Aneurysm, is work-related. Moreover, the disputable presumption of compensability has been satisfied by the facts and circumstances of his employment with petitioners. His employment with petitioners for 23 years, the fact that he was exposed to certain hazards, and that his illness occurred while he was still on board and in the performance of his duties as seaman, justify the applicability of the disputable presumption to his case. Noblefranca also posits that the company-designated physician failed to issue any assessment of fitness or disability after 200 days of treatment. The said fact alone rendered his total temporary disability to permanent total disability, entitling him to permanent total disability benefits. Lastly, as to the imposition of 6% interest rate per annum , Noblefranca invokes that if a judgment did not become final and executory before July 1, 2013 and there was no stipulation in the contract providing for a different interest rate, other money claims under Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8042 shall be subject to the 6% interest per annum in accordance with Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Circular No. 799-13.\nThe petition is bereft of merit.\nNoblefranca's illness is work-related, therefore compensable.\nThe applicable provisions that govern a seafarer's disability claim has been explained by the Court in Jebsen Maritime, Inc. v. Ravena, thus:\nThe entitlement of an overseas seafarer to disability benefits is governed by law, the employment contract, and the medical findings.\nBy law, the seafarer's disability benefits claim is governed by Articles 191 to 193, Chapter VI (Disability benefits) of the Labor Code, in relation to Rule X, Section 2 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code.\nBy contract, it is governed by the employment contract which the seafarer and his employer\/local manning agency executes prior to employment, and the applicable POEA-SEC that is deemed incorporated in the employment contract.\nLastly, the medical findings of the company-designated physician, the seafarer's personal physician, and those of the mutually-agreed third physician, pursuant to the POEA-SEC, govern.\nSince Noblefranca was employed in 2014, the 2010 POEA-SEC governs the procedure for compensation and benefits for a work-related injury or illness suffered by a seafarer on board sea-going vessels during the term of his contract.\nPursuant to Section 20(A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, in order for a disability to be compensable, (i) the injury or illness must be work-related; and (ii) the work-related injury or illness must have existed during the term of the contract of the seafarer. In turn, \"work-related illness\" pertains to such sickness listed as occupational disease under Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC with the set conditions therein satisfied. An illness not listed as occupational disease is, nonetheless, disputably presumed work-related provided that the seafarer proves, by substantial evidence, that his or her work conditions caused or, at the least, increased his or her having contracted the same.\nIn this case, although Noblefranca's illness is not listed as occupational disease, he was able to prove that his work conditions caused or at least exacerbated his chances of having it.\nAs observed by the CA, evidence revealed that Noblefranca, who was by then 55 years of age, was already suffering from high blood pressure and hypertension at the time he boarded M.T. Eneos Ocean on December 21, 2014, as indicated by the PEME results. In a Medical Report dated April 7, 2015, Dr. Cruz, the company-designated physician opined that aortic aneurysm typically affects persons suffering from high blood pressure. Also, the aneurysm occurred while Noblefranca was on board the vessel, while performing his sea duties. It is also important to highlight that Noblefranca had been working for petitioners as a seafarer for 23 years. Undoubtedly, his exposure to various work settings on board the vessel, the stress and fatigue from employment, the risks of being subjected to the perils of the sea, plus the great emotional strain from working away from home and his family, could have, at the very least, contributed to the development of his illness. Joining together these circumstances would lead us to the conclusion that Noblefranca's illness is work-related.\nMoreover, this Court agrees with the CA in classifying Noblefranca's illness as a cardiovascular disease. As such, Noblefranca should be able to satisfy the conditions provided in Item 11 of Section 32-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC to establish work relation and compensability. The pertinent portions of said provision are as follows:\nThe following diseases are considered as occupational when contracted under working conditions involving the risks described herein:\nx x x x\n11. Cardio-vascular events. - to include heart attack, chest pain (angina), heart failure or sudden death. Any of the following conditions must be met:\na. If the heart disease was known to have been present during employment, there must be proof that an acute exacerbation was clearly precipitated by the unusual strain by reasons of the nature of his work.\nb. The strain of work that brings about an acute attack must be sufficient severity and must be followed within 24 hours by the clinical signs of a cardiac insult to constitute causal relationship.\nc. If a person who was apparently asymptomatic before being subjected to strain at work showed signs and symptoms of cardiac injury during the performance of his work and such symptoms and signs persisted, it is reasonable to claim a causal relationship.\nIt is undisputed that the above conditions have also been met because as abovementioned, Noblefranca was already suffering from high blood pressure and hypertension at the time of his employment. While performing his regular sea duties, he found blood in his urine, was immediately treated on board, and then brought to Kawasaki Rinko Hospital. He was later repatriated and admitted to Manila Medical Center and was eventually transferred to Philippine Heart Center where he had his surgical operation for his Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. The foregoing proves that his illness is indeed work-related.\nIn Paringit v. Global Gateway Crewing Services, Inc., citing Magsaysay Maritime Services v. Laurel, the Court emphasized that in determining the compensability of an illness, it is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole reason for the seafarer's illness. A reasonable connection between the disease and work undertaken already suffices:\nSettled is the rule that for illness to be compensable, it is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole and only reason for the illness suffered by the seafarer. It is sufficient that there is a reasonable linkage between the disease suffered by the employee and his work to lead a rational mind to conclude that his work may have contributed to the establishment or, at the very least, aggravation of any pre-existing condition he might have had.\nNoblefranca's illness had become total and permanent in view of the lapse of the 120\/240 window.\nThe CA is also correct for reversing and setting aside the decision of the labor tribunals when they denied Noblefranca's disability claim on the basis of a mere statement by the company-designated physician that his illness is not work-related.\nWe are unconvinced with petitioners' claim that Noblefranca's illness is not work-related. Their reliance on the \"not work-related\" assessment of the company-designated physician is unavailing because it is not a final assessment. A final, conclusive, and definite assessment must clearly state whether the seafarer is fit to work or the exact disability rating, or whether such illness is work-related, and without any further condition or treatment.\nPursuant to Section 20(A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, when a seafarer suffers a work-related injury or illness in the course of employment, the company-designated physician is obligated to arrive at a definite assessment of the fanner's fitness or degree of disability within a period of 120 days from repatriation. During the said period, the seafarer shall be deemed on temporary total disability and shall receive his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the POEA-SEC and by applicable Philippine laws. However, if the 120-day period is exceeded and no definitive declaration is made because the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists. But before the company-designated physician may avail of the allowable 240-day extended treatment period, he must perform some significant act to justify the extension of the original 120-day period. Otherwise, the law grants the seafarer the relief of permanent total disability benefits due to such non­compliance.\nHere, the \"not work-related\" assessment was issued by the company-­designated physician on April 7, 2015. It is important to highlight, however, that Dr. Cruz opined in the same Medical Report that \"Disability is being anticipated.\" A careful review of the records of this case would also show that Noblefranca is not only afflicted with one illness, but two: abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which he was treated, and chronic calculous cholecystitis due to the presence of gallbladder stones. Moreover, in a Medical Report dated July 30, 2015 or 119 days on treatment, the company-­designated physician even recommended that Noblefranca undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The illness was, however, belittled by the succeeding Medical Report dated August 20, 2015 which stated that, \"the diagnosed illness of chronic calculous cholecystitis is an incidental finding and not related to abdominal aneurysm. In a Medical Report dated September 24, 2015 or 175 days on treatment, it was noted that gallbladder stones were still present. Thereafter, medical treatment both for the abdominal aortic aneurysm or its effects and for the chronic calculous chlocystitis was unceremoniously stopped in October 2015 without giving Noblefranca reasons therefor. Clearly, the company-designated physician failed to issue any assessment for fitness of disability to Noblefranca when it suddenly terminated his treatment.\nIn Elburg Shipmanagement Philippines, Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr., the Court summarized the rules regarding the company-designated physician's duty to issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading as follows:\n1. The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer 's disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him;\n2. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total;\n3. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (e.g., seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and\n4. If the company-designated physician still fails to give his assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification.\nA final, conclusive, and definite medical assessment must clearly state whether the seafarer is fit to work or the exact disability rating, or whether such illness is work-related, and without any further condition or treatment. It should no longer require any further action on the part of the company-­designated physician and it is issued by the company-designated physician after he or she has exhausted all possible treatment options within the periods allowed by law.\nWithout a valid, final, and definitive assessment from the company-­designated physician, Noblefranca's temporary and total disability, by operation of law, became permanent and total.\nPayment of Legal Interest\nLastly, pursuant to Franciviel Derama Setoso v. United Philippine Lines, Inc., C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Santos, and Nacar v. Gallery Frames, the Court imposes on the monetary awards legal interest at six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this decision until full payment.\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the instant Petition for Review is DENIED .

CV No. 95433, which denied petitioners' appeal on the February 26, 2010 Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Fernando City, La Union, Branch 28 in Civil Case No. 4557. The trial court dismissed herein petitioners' complaint for Quieting of Title with Damages against the respondents.\nFactual Antecedents:\nJosefina Quejado-Viloria, Remedios Quejado-Gaerlan (Remedios), Benjamin F. Quejado, Demetrio F. Quejado (Demetrio) and Felicitas F. Quejado filed before the trial court a complaint for Quieting of Title with Damages. They claimed ownership over a 10,000-square meter lot located in Taboc, San Juan, La Union (subject property), having inherited the subject property from their predecessor-in-interest who had openly, publicly, continuously and peacefully possessed the same without interruption for more than 30 years in the concept of an owner.\nThe Quejados alleged that the heirs of Segunda Gaetos, Pablo and Salome Gaetos and Justiniano Gaetos, and the children of Francisco Gaetos surreptitiously and without their knowledge and consent caused the subject property to be surveyed for the purpose of claiming ownership. Their acts disturbed and put a cloud on their ownership, possession, and title over the subject property. Efforts toward amicable settlement between parties were exerted before the barangay council but failed.\nThe Gaetos heirs denied the allegations of the heirs of Quejado. They insisted that the Quejados were not the owners of the subject property. They maintained that the Gaetos family owned the property in dispute by virtue of succession from a common ancestor several years before World War II. The subject property was later surveyed through cadastral survey of San Juan, La Union and partitioned as follows:\nLot No. 1429, with and area of 1,678 sq. m., Constantino Gaetos; Lot No. 1430, with an area of 1,112 sq.m., Juan Aman; Lot No. 1431, with an area of 1,844 sq. m., Pablo Gaetos; and Lot No. 1432, with an area of 2,824 sq. m., Salome Gaetos\nThe heirs of Eudoxia Gaetos and Galiciano Gaetos, represented by Mildred Madayag, intervened in the case alleging that they were co-owners of the property in issue.\nTrial ensued.\nThe Quejado heirs presented testimonial evidence pointing to their ownership and possession of the subject property.\nDemetrio and Remedios testified that upon the demise of their parents, they took over the possession of the subject property which was surrounded as follows: North-Chan Family; South-Adelina Paredes; East-Segundo Gaetos; and West-China Sea. To fortify the veracity of their claim of ownership over the land, they also averred that their mother mortgaged the subject property on several occasions with various banks.\nThe testimonies of Eulogia Catbagan (Eulogia) and Vicente Laurea, Sr. (Vicente), a tenant and a neighbor, respectively, were also presented. They both acknowledged the ownership of the Quejados over the subject property. Eulogia attested its \"sandy\" state while Vicente claimed that his brother was a tenant of the subject property. Pieces of documentary evidence, like the mortgages and their cancellation and Tax Declaration Nos. 13457 and 15859 under the name of Demetrio and Remedios' mother, were presented to support their claim of ownership.\nOn the other hand, the heirs of Gaetos adduced the testimony of Isabelo Laurea (Isabelo), who testified that the subject property was near his place and its original owner was the grandfather of Francisco Gaetos. The first tenant of the subject property was Teodoro Laurea, his grandfather, who was succeeded by Cosme Laurea and then his father, Laureano Laurea. The tenancy was later passed on to Isabelo. The subject property was bounded as follows: North­brother of Francisco Gaetos; South-daughter of Edis Agbunag; East-national road; West-sea. He also knew that the husband of Carmen Fernandez bought a land previously owned by Mariano Padua located in the east of the national road. Meanwhile, the house of Carmen Fernandez was located at a distance of 100 meters from his own place but not within the subject property.\nTeresita Ganaden (Teresita), granddaughter of Francisco Gaetos, also testified. She recalled that the subject property was originally owned by Leon Gaetos and Praxedes Pascua, who had six children, namely: Eudoxia, Galiciano, Francisco, Francisca, Feliza, and Raymunda, who were already deceased when the case was instituted. She likewise presented the San Juan, La Union Cadastre Cad 739-D to show that the subject property was partitioned among the six children of Leon and Praxedes Gaetos. Eudoxia acquired the northern portion (Lot 1434); the middle portions were allotted to Galicano (Lot 1433); Francisco was given Lot 1432; Feliza received Lot 1431; Raymunda had Lot 1430; and Francisca got the southern portion or Lot 1429. To bolster their claim, Teresita also presented receipts of expropriation payments for the properties ordered expropriated by the Court of First Instance of La Union, including the decision in the said case involving the subject property. The properties, as apportioned, were subsequently transferred to individual persons, as evidenced by current tax declarations in their names presented before the court.\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court:\nAfter trial, the trial court rendered its February 26, 2010 Decision, finding no merit in the complaint of the Quejados. The dispositive portion of the judgment reads:\nWHEREFORE , in light of the foregoing premises, this court finds preponderance of evidence to be in favor of the defendants and judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the complaint for Quieting of Title with Damages.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe trial court found that the evidence of the Quejados did not convincingly establish that they possessed the property publicly, exclusively, and peacefully in the concept of owners. The trial court also noted that they did not have the requisite title to pursue an action for quieting of title.\nAggrieved, the heirs of Quejado assailed the trial court's judgment before the appellate court.\nRuling of the Court of Appeals:\nThe appellate court denied petitioners' appeal. The dispositive portion of its February 19, 2013 Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the appeal is DENIED . Consequently, the Decision dated 26 February 2010 is hereby AFFIRMED in toto.\nThe appellate court rejected petitioners' appeal on the ground that they failed to prove their title over the subject property and that the tax declarations under the name of their deceased mother, coupled with their allegations of possession of the subject property, did not suffice to substantiate their claims. Thus, there was no reason to overturn the trial court's ruling.\nUndaunted, the petitioners elevated the case before Us raising the sole issue:\nA. WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERROR OF LAW AND ACTED IN A MANNER NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE COURT IN HOLDING THAT \"PLAINTIFF-APPELLANTS FAILED TO PROVE THAT THEY HAVE EITHER LEGAL OR BENEFICIAL TITLE TO INSTITUTE THE ACTION TO QUIET TITLE AGAINST DEFENDANTS­APPELLEES.\"\nPetitioners' Arguments:\nPetitioners argue in their Petition for Review on Certiorari that the appellate court seriously erred in declaring that they have not proven their legal or beneficial title to institute the action to quiet title against the respondents despite the evidence that they have presented. They allege that the uncontroverted tax declarations under the name of their deceased mother support their claim of ownership. Their failure to declare the subject property in their names for taxation purposes does not destroy their title over it.\nMoreover, the fact that the subject property had been mortgaged by their predecessors-in-interest in favor of several banks proves their ownership, considering that it is standard practice for banks to investigate the identity of the owner of the real property being offered as a collateral. The banks' approval of mortgages of the subject property under the name of their predecessors-in-interest points to the veracity of their claim of ownership. Furthermore, respondents' pieces of evidence did not show their actual possession over the subject property, which thus belies their claim of ownership. The testimonial evidence presented by the Gaetoses, particularly as regards the location, identity, and description of the subject property, clearly negates their claim of ownership. Lastly, the cadastral plan and the tax declarations presented by respondents are not conclusive proof of their ownership over the subject property.\nRespondents' Arguments:\nThe respondents, in their Comment, are urging for the outright dismissal of the petition in view of its defective Verification and Certification against Forum Shopping. They point out that not all the petitioners signed the verification and certification against forum shopping. In addition, the petition raised purely factual matters which were already passed upon by the appellate court.\nEven brushing aside technical infirmities, the respondents also aver that petitioners' appeal should nonetheless be denied for they failed to establish by preponderance of evidence their superior, legal, and substantive right over the property in dispute. The pieces of evidence they presented, including the tax declarations under the name of their mother, do not prove ownership and title over the subject property. They stress that both the trial court and the appellate court arrived at the same conclusion, which should no longer be disturbed.\nOur Ruling\nThe petition is denied.\nConsequence of a defective Verification and Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping.\nThe petition's Verification\/Certification on Non-Forum Shopping was not signed by all the parties therein. This defect was duly admitted by the petitioners' in their Reply. However, they argue that such was not fatal nor was it jurisdictional as to affect their present appeal.\nWe agree. Altres v. Empleo laid down the following guidelines with respect to noncompliance with the requirements on or submission of a defective verification and certification against forum shopping:\n1) A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective verification, and non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective certification against forum shopping.\n2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby.\n3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verification, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.\n4) As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of \"substantial compliance\" or presence of \"special circumstances or compelling reasons.\"\n5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule.\n6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to sign on his behalf. (Emphases Ours)\nApplying the above guidelines to the present case, We find that the subject Verification\/Certification of Non-forum Shopping substantially complied with the rules.\nPetitioners share a common interest and have similar claims in the subject property and that any one of them can be considered as \"one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations\" to sign the required verification. Moreover, their assertion of a common cause of action or defense empowers any one of them to sign the certification against forum shopping to substantially comply with the rule. After all, it has been held that under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, as in this case where the petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the rule requiring all such plaintiffs or petitioners to sign the certification against forum shopping may be relaxed.\nIt should be noted that the rules on verification and certification against forum shopping are designed to promote and facilitate the orderly administration of justice. Hence, they should not be interpreted with such absolute literalness as to subvert their own ultimate and legitimate objectives. The requirement of strict compliance merely underscores their mandatory nature to the effect that the verification and certification against forum shopping cannot altogether be dispensed with or their requirements completely disregarded. They do not prohibit substantial compliance with the rules under justifiable circumstances.\nTherefore, this Court cannot dismiss petitioners' appeal at its inception on account of the formal defects in the verification\/certification of non-forum shopping.\nDiscretionary power to review; appeal not a matter of right but must comply with requirements for its perfection.\nRespondents point to another defect in the Petition for Review on Certiorari . It involves petitioners' act of raising purely questions of fact.\nWe emphasize at the outset that a Petition for Review on Certiorari is a remedy under the law confined to settle questions of law and not questions of facts. The settled rule is that only questions of law may be raised in a petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Rule 45, Section 1 reads:\nSection 1. Filing of petition with Supreme Court. - A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari . The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth. (1a, 2a) (Emphasis supplied)\nIn Republic of the Philippines v. Malabanan, this Court distinguished a question of law from a question of fact. \"A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of [undisputed] facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.\"\nQuestion of fact requires courts to review the truthfulness or falsity of the allegations of the parties. This review includes assessment of the \"probative value of the evidence presented.\" There is also a question of fact when the issue presented is the correctness of the lower court's appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties.\nIt is not this Court's function to analyze or weigh all over again evidence already considered in the proceedings below. Our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing only errors of law that may have been committed by the lower court. As it is, the resolution of factual issues is the function of the lower courts, whose findings on these matters are received with respect.\nHowever, this Court may take exceptions when: (1) the conclusion is grounded on speculations, surmises, or conjectures; (2) the inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; (5) the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) there is no citation of specific evidence on which the factual findings are based; (7) the findings of absence of fact are contradicted by the presence of evidence on record; (8) the findings of theCA are contrary to those of the trial court; (9) the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant and undisputed facts that, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; (10) the findings of the CA are beyond the issues of the case; and (11) such findings are contrary to the admissions of both parties. Petitioners, however, must not merely allege the presence of exceptions but must fully explain why exceptions to the rule must apply.\nHere, petitioners raise the lone issue that the appellate court committed serious error of law and acted in a manner not in accord with the applicable decisions of the Court. In support of such issue, they advance the following allegations: (1) the trial court erred in declaring that they do not have the requisite title to pursue their claim, notwithstanding their predecessors-in­interests' possession of the property, who even mortgaged the subject property and declared it under their name for tax purposes; (2) the trial court erred in failing to appreciate and give weight to the evidence presented, the testimonies of their witnesses, and their documentary evidence; and (3) the trial court erred in dismissing their case.\nPetitioners' core allegations would entail a review of the factual circumstances already determined and similarly concluded by the lower courts. They are essentially questioning the lower courts' appreciation of evidence and asking this Court to weigh them all over again, an undertaking that is not allowed in a petition filed under Rule 45. Moreover, this invocation of factual review is bereft of a full explanation why the exception to our reviewing power should be exercised.\nThus, the present petition must fail on this ground.\nEven if we relax the rules on review, the petition must still fail for lack of merit.\nIn an action for quieting of title, the plaintiff has the burden to show by preponderance of evidence that they have a legal and equitable title to or interest in the real property subject of the action.\nSpouses Basa v. Loy reiterated the requirements in order that an action to quiet title may prosper, thus:\nIn order that an action for quieting of title may prosper, it is essential that the plaintiff must have legal or equitable title to, or interest in, the property which is the subject-matter of the action. Legal title denotes registered ownership, while equitable title means beneficial ownership. In the absence of such legal or equitable title, or interest, there is no cloud to be prevented or removed.\nx x x x\nAn action for quieting of title is essentially a common law remedy grounded on equity. The competent court is tasked to determine the respective rights of the complainant and other claimants, not only to place things in their proper place, to make the one who has no rights to said immovable respect and not disturb the other, but also for the benefit of both, so that he who has the right would see every cloud of doubt over the property dissipated, and he could afterwards without fear introduce the improvements he may desire, to use, and even to abuse the property as he deems best. But 'for an action to quiet title to prosper, two indispensable requisites must concur, namely: (1) the plaintiff or complainant has a legal or an equitable title to or interest in the real property subject of the action; and (2) the deed, claim, encumbrance, or proceeding claimed to be casting cloud on his title must be shown to be in fact invalid or inoperative despite its prima facie appearance of validity or legal efficacy.' [Emphasis supplied; citation omitted]\nThe requirements find basis in Articles 476 and 477 of the Civil Code which state:\nArticle 476. Whenever there is a cloud on title to real property or any interest therein, by reason of any instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding which is apparently valid or effective but is in truth and in fact invalid, ineffective, voidable, or unenforceable, and may be prejudicial to said title, an action may be brought to remove such cloud or to quiet the title.\nAn action may also be brought to prevent a cloud from being cast upon title to real property or any interest therein.\nArticle 477. The plaintiff must have legal or equitable title to, or interest in the real property which is the subject matter of the action. ℒαwρhi৷ He need not be in possession of said property.\nIt is thus clear that legal or equitable title to, or interest in, the real property subject matter of the action must be established by the plaintiffs as a prerequisite in order for their action to quiet title to prosper.\nHere, petitioners did not have a legal title to the subject property. There were no certificates of title in their respective names. Moreover, based on the findings of the lower courts, they also failed to substantiate their claim of having equitable title as well. The tax declarations under the names of their predecessor-in-interests, documentation alluding to mortgages, and the testimonial evidence they have presented did not convincingly establish their equitable title over the subject property.\nAs accurately ruled by both the trial court and the appellate court, tax declarations and receipts are not conclusive evidence of ownership or of the right to possess land when not supported by other evidence. Mere allegation of open, continuous, and exclusive possession of the property in dispute without substantiation does not meet the requirements of the law.\nHence, based on the foregoing, petitioners failed at the outset to establish the first requirement of having legal or equitable title over the property in dispute. Their cause of action for quieting of title simply cannot prosper. In view of their lack of title, legal or equitable, there is no cloud to be prevented or removed and there is no case of quieting of title to speak of.\nWHEREFORE , the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby DENIED . The February 19, 2013 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA­G.R. CV No. 95433 is hereby AFFIRMED . Costs on petitioners.\nSO ORDERED.\nLeonen, (Chairperson), Lazaro-Javier,* Delos Santos, and J.

{"id":946,"text":"FIRST DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 253191, May 14, 2021 ]\nMICHELLE MIRO WENCESLAO, PETITIONER, VS. C.F. SHARP CREW MANAGEMENT, INC., ET AL., RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nCARANDANG, J.:\nBefore Us is an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Michelle Miro Wenceslao (Michelle) assailing the Decision dated January 27, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 162014.\nFacts of the Case\nOn March 31, 2017, C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. (CSC), acting on behalf of its foreign principal Norwegian Cruise Line, Ltd., hired Michelle as a waitress onboard M\/S Norwegian Sky. The employment contract is covered by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA).\nOn August 8, 2017, while on board the vessel and performing her duties, Michelle suddenly felt a snap on her lower back as she was turning her trunk. She proceeded to the vessel infirmary due to the low back pain. She also cannot straighten her right hip and right knee. The vessel infirmary initially prescribed Michelle to take muscle relaxants. However, due to the persistent back pain, Michelle was medically repatriated to the Philippines on October 16, 2017.\nOn October 20, 2017, Michelle was immediately examined by the company-designated physicians, where she was found to be suffering from disc bulge and disc desiccation. Michelle underwent a series of physical therapy sessions and medical check-ups. After 18 sessions, she claimed minimal improvement. The company-designated physician reviewed the initial magnetic resonance imaging test of Michelle and conducted an electro-diagnostic test of her lower extremities. On January 18, 2018 and January 22, 2018, after consideration of her persisting low back pain and test results, the company-designated physician recommended Michelle's surgery through a procedure called the Transforminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion of L5-S1.\nOn January 24, 2018, Michelle wrote to the company-designated physician stating that she would prefer alternative treatment for her back pain instead of undergoing surgery. On January 26, 2018, Michelle was discharged by the company-designated physicians from the Orthopedic Spine Surgery. The company-designated physicians prescribed Michelle analgesics and instructed her to do \"self-directed\" strengthening exercises. Michelle claimed that her physical treatments were discontinued without any word from the company-designated physician. As a result, she consulted with a second physician. On March 26, 2018, Michelle's personal physician assessed her to be partially and permanently disabled. The second physician stated that her persistent back pains resulted in her \"inability to tolerate prolonged sitting or standing, inability to tolerate walking a medium range distance, difficulty in going up and down the stairs, and inability to perform moderate to heavy forms of physical activity,\" which rendered her unfit to work as a scafarer.\nWith her medical assessment from the second physician, Michelle filed a complaint through the Single-Entry Approach against CSC. At said proceedings, parties agreed to refer the matter to a third doctor. On July 12, 2018, the parties proceeded to the Philippine Orthopedic Center for consultation with Dr. Leander Peralta. It was at the consultation with the third physician that CSC furnished Michelle a copy of the company-­designated assessment dated January 26, 2018. The assessment of the company-designated physician stated that no definitive management is possible for Michelle due to her refusal to undergo surgery.\nAfter the consultation, the third doctor assessed Michelle's condition with Grade 8 disability rating, partial and permanent disability. Despite the assessment of the third doctor, Michelle insisted that she be paid full disability benefits following the CBA because she failed to return to work for more than 240 days from her repatriation. CSC refused her demand. As a result, Michelle pursued her labor complaint with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).\nAt the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter (LA), Michelle claimed that it was her first time to see the company-designated physician's assessment dated January 27, 2018. Attached to CSC's position paper dated September 24, 2018 is the said assessment stating that Michelle's condition is rated with Grade 6 in accordance with the schedule of disabilities under the 2010 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (2010 POEA-SEC) or \"severe or total rigidity of the trunk or total loss of lifting power of heavy objects.\"\nRuling of the Labor Arbiter\nIn a Decision dated January 28, 2019, the LA awarded Michelle disability benefits following the Grade 8 rating of the third doctor. The LA did not agree with Michelle's claim that the company-designated physician failed to issue a final assessment. The company assessment dated 27 January 2018 consisted of Michelle's Grade 6 disability-rating, issued 103 days from her repatriation, which is well-within the mandated 240-day period under labor laws. In any case, as parties agreed to consult a third physician, the findings of said physician shall be final and binding pursuant to the provisions of the 2010 POEA-SEC. Thus, Michelle is bound by the Grade 8 rating of the third doctor. The LA also held that the benefits awarded under the CBA is inapplicable. Under the CBA, recovery of disability benefits shall be granted when the illness or injury resulted from an accident. The LA found that Michelle's back conditions could not have resulted from an accident, which only entitles her to disability benefits under the 2010 POEA­SEC. The LA awarded US$16,795. as disability benefits corresponding to the Grade 8 rating and US$1 ,679. representing attorney's fees.\nRuling of the National Labor Relations Commission\nMichelle raised her case on appeal with the NLRC Third Division, which affirmed the LA ruling in its Decision dated March 29, 2019.\nMichelle then filed with the CA a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\nIn the assailed Decision dated January 27, 2020, the CA affirmed the ruling of the labor tribunals. The CA held that parties agreed to seek the medical opinion of a third physician, who assessed Michelle's back conditions to be work-related and rated at Grade 8. As the third doctor's medical opinion is binding upon the parties pursuant to the provisions of the 2010 POEA-SEC, Michelle must be awarded disability benefits corresponding to the Grade 8 rating.\nProceedings before the Court\nUnsatisfied with the Decision of the CA, Michelle filed an appeal by certiorari with this Court under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. She reiterated her claim for payment of full disability benefits. She argued that there were consistent conclusions from her personal physician and the third doctor that she remained unfit to return to work. The length of time a seafarer lost their earning capacity is the sole factor in determining whether or not a seafarer is totally and permanently disabled. Here, due to her inability to return to work for more than 240 days, her disability is deemed permanent and total. On that note, Michelle's unfitness to work should prevail over any disability grading, including the Grade 8 rating issued by the third doctor.\nMichelle also claimed that the company-designated physician failed to issue a valid, final and definitive assessment. The assessment dated January 26, 2018 of the company-designated physician did not contain any clear pronouncement as to her capacity to return to work. The company-­designated physician is obligated to issue a final and definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness or unfitness to return to work within 120\/240-day period. Without the timely issuance of the foregoing assessment, the opinions of the independent physician are irrelevant because the seafarer is already conclusively presumed to be suffering from a permanent and total disability. Furthermore, the Grade 6 assessment issued by the company-­designated physician on January 27, 2018 was never presented to Michelle. She claimed that she only learned of the assessment at the LA proceedings, which was already beyond 240 days from her repatriation. The company's failure to timely furnish Michelle a copy of this assessment is a violation of due process.\nFinally, Michelle argued that she is entitled to payment of full disability benefits according to the CBA. The injury she sustained is from an accident. The sudden snap of Michelle's back while in the performance of her duties is considered as an \"unexpected and unfortunate\" occurrence. Considering that she qualifies with the application of the CBA, the amount of US$1 00,000. should be paid as full disability benefits. She also prayed for payment of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.\nIn the Comment, CSC argued that the petition be dismissed outright. An appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court shall only relate to questions of law. In filing the instant petition, Michelle sought for a factual review of the case. However, Michelle failed to demonstrate that her case falls in any of the exceptions for this Court to take cognizance of her petition. Moreover, the labor tribunals and the CA have consistently ruled that Michelle is only entitled to the disability benefits corresponding with the Grade 8 rating of the third doctor. Michelle cannot depart from this especially since she agreed to the consultation with the third physician. The 2010 POEA-SEC is also explicit that the disability grading of the third doctor shall be final and binding upon the parties. The assessment of the third physician stands and cannot be interpreted as a declaration that Michelle's back condition is permanent and total. Finally, the provisions of the CBA are inapplicable because Michelle's back injury did not result from an accident. Michelle is also not entitled to payment of damages and attorney's fees.\nMichelle filed a Reply reiterating her arguments in the petition.\nRuling of the Court\nAs a rule, an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court pe1iains to questions of law. It does not extend to factual issues. However, in the exercise of discretionary review, this Court may take cognizance of the petition when the findings of fact and the conclusions of the assailed judgment are not in accordance with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court. Here, We find that the CA erred in applying the third doctor rule provided in the 2010 POEA-SEC.\nThe procedures for the seafarer to seek the medical opinion of a second physician and later a third physician ensues when the seafarer contests the final assessment of the company-designated physician. This is embodied in Section 20(A)(3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC which states that \"if a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment [of the company designated physician], a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the seafarer.\" The rule further states that the third doctor's assessment shall be final and binding on the parties. Clearly, this rule presupposes that the company-designated physician must have issued a valid, final, and definite assessment on the seafarer's fitness or unfitness to work for without it, the second physician or ultimately the third doctor rule will not apply.\nTo constitute a final and definitive assessment issued by the company-­designated physician, the same must \"state whether the seafarer is fit to work or the exact disability rating, or whether such illness is work-related.\" The final assessment of the company-designated physician should be issued within 120 days from the date of the seafarer's medical repatriation, or within 240 days if supported with justification for extension of medical treatment. Failure to issue a final assessment within the foregoing periods renders a seafarer's illness or injury permanent and total regardless of justification. Aside from the timely issuance of the company-designated physician's medical assessment within the 120\/240-day periods, the company or its doctors are mandated to furnish the same to the seafarer. The seafarer must be fully and properly informed of his medical condition. The results of his\/her medical examinations, the treatments extended to him\/her, the diagnosis and prognosis, if needed, and, of course, his\/her disability grading must be fully explained to him\/her by no less than the company-designated physician. The seafarer must be accorded proper notice and due process especially where his\/her well-being is at stake. The effect of failure of the company to furnish the seafarer a copy of his medical certificate militates gravely against the company's cause.\nApplying the foregoing principles, We cannot uphold the Grade 8 rating of the third doctor because Michelle was not issued or furnished within 120\/240 days of the company-designated physician's final assessment. On record, Michelle consistently claimed from the proceedings with the LA to this Court that she was only furnished the company­-designated physician assessment during consultations with the third doctor or 269 days from her repatriation. Notably, this assessment dated January 26, 2018 does not constitute a final and definitive assessment as it is only a narration of events that led to Michelle's repatriation, the treatments she underwent and the diagnosis of disc bulge and disc desiccation, L5-S1. To reiterate, a final and definitive assessment must state that the seafarer is fit to work or the exact disability rating, or whether such illness is work-related.\nEven if We consider the Grade 6 assessment dated January 27, 2018 as the final assessment, the company did not furnish the assessment to Michelle within the mandated periods. CSC does not dispute Michelle's assertion that she only learned of the same when the company appended a copy in its position paper submitted at the LA proceedings. Notably, the proceedings were held months after the third doctor's consultation and long beyond 240 days from her repatriation. There is neither proof nor allegation that Michelle had been timely furnished of the assessment and that it had been explained to her at any time prior the LA proceedings. The Grade 6 assessment may explain the company's discontinuance or conclusion of Michelle's medical treatments and contradicts the company's inability to assess Michelle's conditions. Unfortunately, the company did not furnish Michelle of this assessment leaving her guessing the status of her health.\nWithout furnishing the final assessment to Michelle within the mandated 120\/240-day periods, she was not given any opportunity to evaluate her medical assessment. As there was no definitive and final assessment from the company-designated physician to contest, seeking the medical opinion of a second physician or even a third physician could not have ensued. Relatedly, CSC's failure to furnish Michelle a final assessment within the foregoing periods rendered her disability permanent and total.\nAs to the monetary award of full disability benefits, We find the provisions of the 2010 POEA-SEC applicable and not the CBA. Article 21 of the CBA reads:\nArticle 21 - Disability\nA seafarer who suffers a disabling permanent injury as a result of an accident from any cause whatsoever whilst in the employment of Norwegian, regardless of fault, including accidents occurring whilst travelling to or from the Ship and whose ability to work is reduced as a result thereof, shall in addition to his Sick Pay, be entitled to compensation according to the provisions of this Agreement.\nFrom the foregoing, in order to benefit from the provisions of the CBA, the seafarer's disability must have resulted from an accident. The term \"accident\" may be used as denoting a calamity, casualty, catastrophe, disaster, an undesirable or unfortunate happening; any unexpected personal injury resulting from any unlooked for mishap or occurrence; any unpleasant or unfortunate occurrence, that causes injury, loss, suffering or death; some untoward occurrence aside from the usual course of events. In this case, Michelle's back pain resulted from turning her trunk while in the performance of her duties as a waitress. Her condition is simply aggravated by work. In fact, the company-designated physician opined that if the patient's work involves repetitive and\/or strenuous activities of the back, then these conditions is considered work-related. Other than the fact that Michelle was in the performance of her duties, there is no proof of unlooked mishaps, occurrences, or fortuitous events that could have resulted in her condition. The provisions of the CBA are inapplicable.\nAnent Michelle's prayer for payment of moral and exemplary damages, We find no reason to award the same. We are unconvinced that CSC acted in bad faith. ℒαwρhi৷ From the facts, Michelle had been closely monitored and medically treated by the company doctors for four months since her repatriation. CSC even cooperated in seeking the medical opinion of a third physician. The company could not have acted in bad faith in seeking to uphold the Grade 8 disability rating of the third doctor. The only misgiving We find is the company's failure to timely furnish Michelle the final disability assessment of the company-designated physician which resulted in the award of permanent and total disability benefits. Finally, Michelle is awarded attorney's fees at 10% of the monetary award because she was forced to litigate her interests.\nWHEREFORE , the Decision dated January 27, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 162014 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE . Respondents C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc., et al. are ORDERED to pay petitioner Michelle Miro Wenceslao:\n1) US$60,000. representing permanent and total disability benefits under the 2010 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract;\n2) Sickness allowance, if none had been paid; and\n3) Attorney's fees at ten percent (10%) of the monetary award.\nAll amounts shall earn six percent (6%) interest per annum from finality of this Decision until full satisfaction.\nSO ORDERED.\nGesmundo, C.

SERPA JUAN AND JOHN DOES, RESPONDENTS.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nINTING, J.:\nThe Petition for Review assails the Decision dated October 11, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 140092. In the assailed Decision, the CA sustained the Decision dated October 10, 2014 of Branch 57, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Makati City affirming the Decision dated June 17, 2013 of Branch 64, Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Makati City. The MeTC dismissed petitioners' complaint for forcible entry and damages.\nLikewise being challenged is the CA Resolution dated March 27, 2018 denying the Motion for Reconsideration (of the Decision dated October 11, 2017).\nThe Antecedents\nIn their Complaint for Forcible Entry and Damages with Prayer for Mandatory Injunction, petitioners made the following assertions against Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA); then BCDA President and Chief Executive Officer, Amel Paciano D. Casanova; and City Engineer of Taguig City, Marcelo M. Serpa Juan (collectively, respondents):\n2. [Petitioners] are legitimate occupants of the property described as Lot 3-A and Lot 3-B of [S]ubd. [P]lan, Psd-74138 being a portion of Parcel 3 PSU 2031 (GLRO) (LRC Rec No. 2484), situated in the Municipality of Makati, Province of Rizal x x x containing all area of 68,232 square meters and 71,749 square meters[,] respectively[,] or [a] total area of 139,981 square meters;\n3. [Petitioners] occupied the afore-described property for more than thirty years or less upon the consent of the registered owner, Agustina Huerva Alfabeto [Agustina], the grandmother of [petitioner Jacobina T. Alcantara] [Jacobina];\n4. Upon the execution of the Deed of Waiver and Transfer of Rights by the grandmother of [Jacobina] in her favor, she likevv1se allowed her [co-petitioners] to occupy it and continue occupying it if they have been previously occupying the subject property;\n5. The possession of [Jacobina] over the afore-described property was and is under [the] claim of ownership as the rights, interests and participation of her grandmother over the same was transferred to her via a Deed of Waiver and Transfer of Rights which was inscribed and annotated in her grandmother's Transfer Certificate of Title x x x;\n6. While the [petitioners] were in peaceful and undisturbed possession of the subject property for more than three decades x x x, sometime in April 2012[, BCDA,] in connivance with [the other respondents) and their cohorts forcibly entered\/invaded the portion of the subject property [through] force, intimidation, threat, stealth or strategy by first sending notices to all [petitioners] therein denominated as \"Patalastas Ukol sa Paglikas [Tatlumpong (30) Araw Na Abiso]\" requiring them to vacate and demolish their structures otherwise, [respondents] will take legal step to demolish their structures in accordance with RA 7279[, otherwise] known as Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992 x x x;\n7. x x x To show force of their influence, power and authority, [respondents] again without any Court order bulldozed the road of the subject property over the objection and against the will of (petitioners] and prevent them from getting in and out of the portion of the subject property which were already bulldozed and fenced x x x\n8. x x x [Jacobina] requested [respondents] to refrain from threatening and sending notices of ejectment to [petitioners but respondents] disregarded said letter and continued to forcibly enter\/invade the other portion of the subject property thru intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth to the latter's great damage and prejudice. x x x\nThe BCDA, on its end, countered that Jacobina's claim of ownership was fraudulent because the subject property is a military reservation since the 1950s as decreed by then President Carlos P. Garcia under Proclamation No. 423. It also stressed that it is the lawful owner of the disputed property under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 004 highlighting that:\n\"The tract of land covered by OCT No. 004 is only a portion of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG) property, which, as a whole, constitutes roughly 39. hectares. On the other hand, the BCDA property from the JUS:MAG tract of land comprises of 355,042 square meters and is covered by TCT Nos. 11481, 11482 and OCT No. 004. The JUSMAG property, in turn, is just part of an even bigger property, the Fort William P.c Kinley, later renamed as Fort Andres Bonifacio Military Reservation (FBMR), so constituted under Proclamation No. 423 on 12 July 1957.\"\nAccording to the BCDA, TCT No. 340178 in the name of Agustina was derived from TCT No. 258699, which, in turn, emanated from OCT No. 291 that had been cancelled already. The BCDA stressed that in fact, the Court had ruled that the BCDA has ownership over FBMR by virtue of RA 7227.\nIn fine, the BCDA insisted that it did not forcibly enter the subject property since it is its legal owner and petitioners have no right over it as the sole basis for their claim was a title that originated from OCT No. 291 that had already been declared cancelled.\nRuling of the MeTC\nOn June 17, 2013, the MeTC dismissed the complaint for lack of merit. It emphasized that the TCT relied upon by petitioners traces its roots from OCT No. 291 which was registered ort October 17, 1906. It added that OCT No. was already cancelled and the land covered by it was conveyed and ceded to the Republic of the Philippines and later on, the same property was transferred to the BCDA by virtue of RA 7227. It ruled that being the registered owner, the BCDA was entitled to the possession of the subject property because possession was one of the attributes of ownership.\nThe MeTC also elucidated that respondents did not forcibly enter the property in question because they were authorized to extrajudicially and summarily evict petitioners pursuant to RA 7279.\nRuling of the RTC\nOn appeal, the RTC affirmed the MeTC Decision. It also denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration which prompted them to file a petition for review with the CA.\nRuling of the CA\nOn October 11, 2017, the CA rendered the assailed Decision affirming the Decision of the RTC.\nThe CA ratiocinated that considering that both parties presented their supposed titles over the subject land, it became incumbent upon the lower courts to include a provisional resolution of the ownership of the property, but only for the purpose of determining the issue of possession. It ruled that as between the two titles presented, the title of the BCDA is superior because at the time Ricardo sold the subject land to Agustina on January 30, 1958, the property was already declared part of the military reservation by PD 423 issued on July 12, 1957, Put in another way, because the sale between Ricardo and Agustina was subsequent to PD 423, wherein the subject property is already part of a military reservation zone (FBMR), then the sale between them is void.\nThe CA also stressed that the title from which petitioners based their ownership (TCT No. 340178) was void because it derived its existence from OCT No. 291 that pertained to a government property characterized as such since 1915. It added that petitioners could not feign ignorance that they were occupying a property that was included in areas declared as a military reservation zone because the title they relied upon indicated it to be so.\nFinally, the CA ruled that the BCDA had the authority to enter the subject property and cause the demolition of the structure built thereon even without a court order pursuant to RA 7279.\nOn March 27, 2018, the CA denied the Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioners. Undaunted, they filed the instant Petition for Review.\nIssue\nDid the CA correctly affirm the ruling of the RTC that sustained the MeTC Decision dismissing the case?\nThe Court's Ruling\nThe petition is bereft of merit.\nForemost, the issue of who between the parties are entitled to the material possession of the subject property involves factual matters which are beyond the ambit of a petition for review on certiorari . The Court is not a trier facts and only questions of law may be raised in a Rule 45 petition. While there are exceptions to this rule, none of which was present here. Added to this, the findings of facts of the trial courts, especially when affirmed by the CA, are conclusive and binding upon the Court, unless the case falls within any of the exceptions to the rule, which exceptions are, nonetheless, not established here.\nUnder the circumstances, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the uniform rulings of the MeTC, RTC, and CA dismissing the case for lack of merit.\nMore importantly, as underscored by the courts a quo , in Acting Registrars of Land Titles and Deeds of Pasay City, Pasig and Makati, Metro Manila v. RTC, Br. 57, Makati, Metro Manila, the Court had the occasion to explain that OCT No. 291 (the alleged title from which TCT No. 340178 relied upon by petitioners originated) had been conveyed to the United States of America and was eventually ceded to the Republic of the Philippines; and resultantly, OCT No. 291 was cancelled upon the final order of the then Court of Land Registration. Thus, the Court took judicial notice that the land covered by OCT No. 291 covered government property, to wit:\nI\nIs OCT No. 291 still valid and subsisting?\nThe Court takes judicial notice of the fact that the hectarage embraced by TCT No. 192 (OCT No. 291) consists of Government property. Three things persuade the Court: (1) the decrees of Proclamations Nos. 192 and 435; (2) the incontrovertible fact that OCT No. 291 has been duly cancelled; and (3) the decision of the Court of Appeals in AC-G.R CV No. 00293, affirming the decision of Hon. Gregorio. Pineda, Judge of the then Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch XXI, in LRC (GLRO) Rec. No. 2484, Case No. R-1467 thereof, entitled \"In Re: Issuance of Owner's Duplicate of Certificate of Title No. 291,\" as well as our own Resolution, in G.R. No. 69834, entitled \"Domingo Palomares, et al., v. Intermediate Appellate Court.\"\nIn the decretal portion of the decision of the same case, the Court specified that \"[OCT] No. 291 is declared duly cancelled\" which only means that no further and subsequent conveyance can be made on the basis of said title.\nMoreover, jurisprudence has repeatedly explained that a military reservation cannot be registered or be a subject of a private disposition or appropriation unless it will be declared alienable and disposable land 'of public domain. In Rep. of the Phils. v. Southside Homeowners Ass'n., Inc. (Southside Homeowners), the Court ruled that the disputed land therein was and still part of FBMR and therefore, inalienable and beyond the commerce of man.\nInterestingly, like the land in Southside Homeowners, the property subject of the present case involves a parcel of land which is a \"portion of Parcel 3 PSU-2031\" Evidently, the subject property remains part of a military reservation and cannot be placed under private appropriation or disposition. To be sure, as decreed by the Court in Southside Homeowners, the land that constitutes Parcel No. 3 of Plan PSU 2031 located within FBMR is reserved for military purposes and courts can and should take judicial notice of the fact of reservation as embodied under Proclamation No. 423.\nOn the basis of all the foregoing, the Court agrees with the findings of the lower courts that the purported sale of the property in question from Ricardo to Agustina was void as it involved a government property that cannot be placed under private appropriation. Consequently, the dismissal of the case is warranted because petitioners anchor their supposed right to possess the property from the title of Agustina which, as discussed, is void.\nMeanwhile, being its owner, the BCDA is entitled to possess and can evict petitioners from the subject property.\nTo stress, in Samahan ng Masang Pilipino sa Makati, Inc. v. Bases Conversion Dev't. Authority, the Court confirmed the ownership of the BCDA over the land covered by FBMR. It also decreed that under RA 7227, the BCDA has the mandate to take over and administer the FBMR. Its ownership includes the right to take possession which is a direct consequence and attribute of ownership.\nIn addition, pursuant to Section 28(b), RA 7279, the BCDA is permitted to extrajudicially cause the eviction of petitioners and the demolition of the structures they built on the property. Such is the case since eviction and demolition are necessary for the implementation of government infrastructure projects. The Court also quotes with approval the observation of the CA that the BCDA still gave prior notice and assistance to petitioners despite not being required to do so, to wit:\nIt is likewise worth noting that the BCDA, though not required under [RA] 7279, still extended the courtesy to notify petitioners of the impending demolition, but they refused to receive such notification. The BCDA even went to the extent of offering relocation and financial aid to those who will be affected by the said demolition. There can thus be no shortcoming, procedural or substantive, that may be attributed to the BCDA in effecting the demolition on the subject property as it was merely exercising its rights as the registered owner of the subject property.\nAll told, the CA properly affirmed the ruling of the RTC, which sustained the MeTC Decision dismissing the case for lack of merit.\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED .

HERNANDEZ, AND FABIAN S. DEE, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nINTING, J.:\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Decision dated September 13, 2017 and the Resolution dated November 23, 2017 rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 136398 which affirmed the Decision dated January 30, 2014 and the Resolution dated May 28, 2014 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC NCR Case No. 01-01053-13\/NLRC LAC No. 05-001674-13. The NLRC vacated and set aside the Decision dated May 2, 2013 of the Labor Arbiter (LA) and found Karen G. Jaso (petitioner) to have been validly dismissed by respondent Metrobank & Trust Co. (Metrobank).\nThe Antecedents\nThis case stemmed from a complaint for illegal dismissal with prayer for reinstatement, payment of full backwages, damages, and attorney's fees filed by petitioner against Metrobank and its officers, Fabian S. Dee (Dee), Vivian Lee-Tiu (Lee-Tiu), Rowena B. De Grano (De Grano), and Maria Zarah C. Hernandez (Hernandez).\nIn her Complainant's Position Paper, petitioner alleged the following:\nPetitioner was hired by Metrobank as a Management Trainee on July 16, 2012. On January 2, 2013, Hernandez, Head of Employee Relations Division, issued a Show Cause Order charging her with \"Gross and habitual negligence in the performance of Official Duties, Unprofessional behavior; and Unauthorized absences\/Non-disclosure of material information\/Dishonesty.\" Petitioner submitted a Letter of explanation dated January 9, 2013 refuting the charges against her. In a Letter dated January 14, 2013, Hernandez dismissed petitioner from employment effective January 15, 2013.\nPetitioner further alleged that: (1) her termination was unjust, invalid, and carried out without observance of due process; (2) Metrobank did not afford her any job orientation to effectively discharge her task; and (3) when she received the notice of termination on January 14, 2013, she was already a regular employee of Metrobank having been in the service for more than six months as of January 12, 2013.\nIn its Position Paper, Metrobank averred the following:\nPetitioner initially applied for the position of Compensation Officer. During the job interview, De Grano, Deputy Head of Employee Services Division, explained to petitioner that she lacked the necessary qualifications to be hired outright as a Compensation Officer; and that they could only offer her the position of Management Trainee, which is a probationary employment. De Grano further explained to her that if she qualifies for regularization upon meeting the skills and attitude expected of her, she will be endorsed for the Officership's Development Program.\nPetitioner agreed, thus Metrobank hired her as a Management Trainee on July 16, 2012.\nMetrobank explained to petitioner the standards to be met to become a regular employee and furnished her with copies of the following documents: 1) Performance Appraisal Management System Sheet; 2) Orientation Checklist; and 3) the Key Result Areas of a management trainee, indicating the corresponding rating standard for regularization which is at least 3.. Petitioner committed to achieve the standards for regularization and signed the foregoing documents on July 25, 2012. Petitioner also attended seminars on how to qualify as a regular employee, one of which was the New Employees Orientation held on August 1 to 3, 2012 where the criteria for regularization were discussed.\nAt the time of petitioner's engagement, Metrobank informed her that she needs to achieve an overall performance rating of at least 3. to become a regular employee and undergo the Officer's Development Program to become a Compensation Officer; and that an appraisal rating of \"Below Meets Standard\" or lower will not afford her employment regularization and would also mean termination of her probationary employment.\nMetrobank alleged that petitioner's performance from July 16, 2012 to December 2012 was assessed to determine her fitness to become a regular employee. However, her overall performance appraisal rating was only 2., which is equivalent to the descriptive rating of \"Below Meets Standard.\" Likewise, petitioner was found lacking in skills and attitude to become an officer of the bank based on her Core Competency Assessment as of December 26, 2012.\nMetrobank further alleged that petitioner displayed improper behavior on December 17, 2012. On said date, De Grano called the attention of petitioner on account of the critical errors she committed in a banking document called \"RF Regularization Evaluation Sheets\" and to inform her of her disqualification to join the Officership Development Program. Upon learning the news, petitioner reacted, \"[h]indi ko na po kaya ito!\" and left the meeting. De Grano asked petitioner to explain her outburst, but petitioner suddenly threw her belongings around.\nRuling of the LA\nIn the Decision dated May 2, 2013, the LA ruled in favor of petitioner and ordered Metrobank to: (1) reinstate her under the same terms and conditions before her dismissal; and (2) pay petitioner back wages of P80,136., computed from the date of the LA Decision plus 10% attorney's fees. The LA exonerated Dee, Lee-Tiu, De Grano, and Hernandez from all liabilities.\nThe LA held that petitioner's six-month probationary employment commenced on July 16, 2012, \"thus, valid until 16 December 2012;\" that her performance appraisal was belatedly made on December 26, 2012, or ten days after the expiration of her probationary employment, and thus, she already became a regular employee who never had the opportunity to be informed if she truly failed to comply with the regularization standards of Metrobank; and that \"the absence, ergo, of a just cause or an authorized cause regarding [petitioner's] dismissal marred the same with illegality.\"\nAggrieved, Metrobank appealed to the NLRC, while petitioner partially appealed the LA's ruling exonerating respondents De Grano, Hernandez, Dee, and Lee-Tiu from all liabilities.\nRuling of the NLRC\nIn the Decision dated January 30, 2014, the NLRC found petitioner's partial appeal bereft of merit and Metrobank's appeal meritorious. It disagreed with the LA that petitioner became a regular employee of Metrobank as early as December 16, 2012; that her six-month probationary employment commenced on July 16, 2012; and that her employment expired on January 17, 2013. In so ruling, the NLRC cited Article 13 of the Civil Code of the Philippines which states that in computing the period, the first day shall be excluded and the last day included.\nThe NLRC also pointed out that petitioner was informed of the standards to become a regular employee as shown by the Orientation Checklist, which she signed; it enumerated all the materials given to her and the orientations she underwent on July 25, 2012. The NLRC likewise found Metrobank to have complied with the basic requirements of due process in ending petitioner's probationary employment.\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration, but the NLRC denied it m the Resolution dated May 28, 2014.\nPetitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA praying that the LA Decision be reinstated with modification in that De Grano and Hernandez be held jointly and solidarily liable with Metrobank for illegal termination; and that respondents be directed to pay her backwages, attorneys fees, moral and exemplary damages of not less than P1,000,000..\nRuling of the CA\nIn the Decision dated September 13, 2017, the CA dismissed the Petition for Certiorari for lack of merit and upheld the NLRC. It ruled that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion when it vacated and set aside the ruling of the LA, explaining as follows:\nx x x Jaso had more than sufficient knowledge of the standards her job entails since Metrobank had not been remiss in reminding her of the standards against which her performance shall be assessed and evaluated and of the fact that her regularization would depend on her ability and capacity to fulfill the requirements of her position as a Management Trainee such that failure to adequately perform the same would lead to her non-regularization and the eventual termination of her probationary employment. Indeed, Metrobank substantially complied with the rule on notification of standards.\nPetitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the CA denied it in the Resolution dated November 23, 2017.\nHence, the instant petition.\nPetitioner imputes error on the part of the CA in ratiocinating that \"there could be no illegal dismissal to speak of as [petitioners] probationary employment was validly terminated for her failure to qualify as a regular employee, as evidenced by her low performance rating, other infractions committed, and attitude below par compared to the company's standard required of her.\"\nPetitioner argues that Metrobank presented no proof of the alleged performance standards to be met and contends that she was not apprised of any performance criteria at the time of her engagement.\nMoreover, she avers that her termination from employment is baseless as Metrobank has no proof of the infractions she allegedly committed.\nRuling of the Court\nThe petition is without merit.\nPetitioner was apprised of the standards that she must meet at the time of her engagement.\nArticle 296 [Formerly 281 of the Labor Code of the Philippines (Labor Code), as amended, provides:\nArticle 296. Probationary Employment.  Probationary employment shall not exceed six (6) months from the date the employee started working, unless it is covered by an apprenticeship agreement stipulating a longer period. The services of an employee who has been engaged on a probationary basis may be terminated for a just cause or when he fails to quality as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his engagement. An employee who is allowed to work after a probationary period shall be considered a regular employee.\nLikewise, Section 6(d) of Rule VIII-A of the Amending the Rules Implementing Books III and VI of the Labor Code, As Amended, provides:\nSECTION 6. Permissible contracting or subcontracting. x x x\nx x x\n(d) In all cases of probationary employment, the employer shall make known to the employee the standards under which he will qualify as a regular employee at the time of his engagement. Where no standards are made known to the employee at that time, he shall be deemed a regular employee.\nx x x\nAn employee on probation is on trial for an employer, during which the latter determines whether or not the employee is qualified for regular employment. During this period, the employer is given the chance to observe the fitness of an employee while at work to ascertain his efficiency and productivity. The probationary employee, on the other hand, seeks to show his employer that he has the competence to meet reasonable standards for regular employment. It is primordial that at the start of the probationary period, the standards for regularization be made known to the probationary employee.\nIn Abbott Laboratories, Phils., et al. v. Alcaraz , an employer is deemed to have made known the standards that would qualify a probationary employee to be a regular employee when it has exerted reasonable efforts to apprise the employee of what he\/she is expected to do or accomplish during the trial period of probation. 1a⍵⍴h!1 This goes without saying that the employee is sufficiently made aware of his\/her probationary status as well as the length of time of the probation.\nIn the case, the record shows that petitioner was made aware of the six-month probationary character of her employment. Petitioner herself admitted in her Letter dated January 9, 2013 that she did not right away accept the Management Trainee position because this would mean being on probation status for a couple of months. Upon acceptance of the Management Trainee position, petitioner's Employment Agreement with Metrobank specifically stated that she was to be placed on probation for six months.\nRecord also discloses that petitioner was notified of her job requirements. On July 25, 2012, she received an Orientation Checklist wherein she confirmed receipt of the following documents: (a) Job Description of the employee; (b) Human Resource Management Group (HRMG) Personnel Policy Manual; (c) HRMG Operating Manual; (d) CBA Handbook; and (e) Employee's Performance Appraisal Management System sheet. In the Orientation Checklist, she also confirmed having attended a detailed orientation of the above-mentioned documents wherein the criteria for regularization, such as the company's expectations on her attitude, pro-activeness, ability to work under pressure and work output quality, were also discussed.\nPetitioner confirmed her awareness of the company's performance appraisal rating as early as July 2012, signifying her understanding that her performance is subject to appraisal. In her Letter dated January 9, 2013, she stated:\nx x x Vivian Lee-Tiu told Emmanuel Pascual to teach me all the [\"]Business as usual[\"] first for it is difficult to absorb all at once. She also removed the Foreign Offices function from me. In short, I absorbed the functions of the Compensation staff who resigned, which are the JO promotions and the business as usual. During that time, Emmanuel Pascual gave my Performance Appraisal rating form. Then, on July 31, 2012, Emmanuel Pascual left Metrobank. x x x (Emphasis supplied.)\nIt must be stressed that Metrobank hired petitioner as a Management Trainee. Significantly, Management Trainees are hired to work and train alongside managers and executives with the intention that one day they will become a manager within the organization. Due to the nature and variety of these managerial functions, it is already sufficient that they are informed of their duties and responsibilities, the adequate performance of which is the inherent and implied standard for regularization; this is unlike other jobs, such as in sales, where a quantitative regularization standard, like a sales quota, is readily articulable to the employee at the outset.\nIn the case, the record shows that petitioner was informed of her duties and responsibilities as a Management Trainee and was also apprised of what was expected of her to accomplish as a probationary employee. On one occasion, she was informed that she would be handling not only compensation matters but also \"Foreign Offices\" functions. In her Letter dated January 9, 2013, she narrated \"Rowena De Grano told me before she left for London that, Karen, pagbalik ko dapat alam na alam mo na yung Foreign Offices ah x x x.\"\nAnother instance was when Lee-Tiu informed petitioner through De Grano to make a \"Proposal to Mancom\" which shall be considered as petitioner's pre-regularization project. Unfortunately, Metrobank found petitioner's performance to be unsatisfactory. She admitted in her letter that De Grano noticed her lack of proficiency in writing and allegedly gave her the remark, \"[p]ansin ko, hindi ka marunong magsulat! Eh di ba may Master's ka naman.\"\nAll things considered, there is substantial evidence to hold that petitioner was indeed sufficiently apprised of the reasonable standards to be met to quality as a regular employee. The quantum of proof which the employer must discharge is merely substantial evidence which, as jurisprudence pronounces, means that amount of relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds, equally reasonable, might conceivably opine otherwise. To the Court's mind, this threshold of evidence was satisfied by Metrobank.\nPetitioner failed to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with the standards for regularization.\nA probationary employee, like a regular employee, enjoys the security of tenure. However, in cases of probationary employment, aside from just or authorized causes of termination, an additional ground is provided under Article 295 of the Labor Code, i.e., the probationary employee may also be terminated for failure to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with the reasonable standards made known by the employer to the employee at the time of the engagement. Thus, the services of an employee who has been engaged on a probationary basis may be terminated for any of the following: (a) a just or (b) an authorized cause; and (c) when he fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards prescribed by the employer.\nIn the case, not only did petitioner have a failing mark of 2. that fell under the \"Below Meet Standards\" rating when her performance was appraised, she also violated bank policies when she failed to detect the errors in the document called \"RF Regularization Evaluation Sheets.\" In the form, she wrote \"Promotion Criteria\" instead of \"Regularization Criteria.\" She also made it appear that two probationary employees underwent training on specific dates when in fact they did not. Further, she also made allegations that other employees incurred job-related cash accountabilities when these employees were never made to handle cash. While petitioner admitted her lapses, she gave as an excuse the fact that all the other previous employees also made similar mistakes.\nPetitioner likewise committed misconduct and improper behavior during her trial period by being unprofessional and childish towards her superior De Grano on December 17, 2012. She confirmed and narrated the incident in her Letter dated January 9, 2013, viz .:\nGoing back to the incident last December 17, 2012, I returned to my area and got my hanky. Rowena De Grano shouted and said \"hindi pa tayo tapos, bumalik ka dito!\" I hid in my area and tried to stop crying. She went to my area and said that I was making a scene. I answered, \"wala naman po akong ginagawa\" . I did not sit on my chair; I squatted because I do not want to be seen. She was the one making a scene because she was shouting to be heard by the whole department. She was holding my elbow and forcing me to stand. I was then forced to go to her inside the conference room because she kept on shouting.\nInside the conference room, she continued to shout. She said, \"In my entire career I have not experienced like this before, you are unprofessional and with attitude problem\". She forced me to speak so I shouted, \"Ang hirap sa inyo, parang wala na akong ginawang tama dito.\" After that, she let Arwin Umali leave the conference room. 1âшphi1\nShe let me calm first and said that I should have not shouted in the presence of Arwin Umali. She said that in few minutes time, the whole HR will know what happened to me.\nFurthermore, petitioner incurred absences from December 18, 2012 to January 14, 2013 without filing a leave of absence. In justifying her unauthorized absences, she intimated that filing a leave of absence would be useless because its approval usually takes a month or two to secure, viz .:\nI am aware that I need to file my leave in e-Attendance. x x x For your information, the Employee Services Division's leaves and overtime from August to October were only approved by her last November. Before I left, Employee Services Division's leaves and overtime for November and December were not yet approved. Even if I applied earlier, she cannot approve it right away.\nFrom the foregoing, petitioner offered glimpses of her disrespectful attitude toward her superiors and her propensity to disregard established company policies and bank rules. As such, the Court finds substantial evidence that petitioner indeed failed to qualify as a regular employee following Metrobank's standards for regularization.\nPetitioner was still a probationary employee on the date of her termination.\nPetitioner now contends that having been engaged on July 16, 2012, her six-month probationary contract was completed on January 12, 2013. Hence, she was already a regular employee at the time of her dismissal on January 15, 2013.\nOn this issue, the ruling of the Court in Alcira v. National Labor Relations Commission ( Alcira ), citing CALS Poultry Supply Corp. v. Roco ( CALS Poultry ), is instructive, viz .:\nPetitioner insists that he already attained the status of a regular employee when he was dismissed on November 20, 1996 because, having started work on May 20, 1996, the six-month probationary period ended on November 16, 1996. According to petitioner's computation, since Article 13 of the Civil Code provides that one month is composed of thirty days, six months total one hundred eighty days. As the appointment provided that petitioner's status was \"probationary (6 mos.)\" without any specific date of termination, the 180th day fell on November 16, 1996. Thus, when he was dismissed on November 20, 1996, he was already a regular employee.\nPetitioner's contention is incorrect. In CALS Poultry Supply Corporation, et al. vs. Roco, et al., this Court dealt with the same issue of whether an employment contract from May 16, 1995 to November 15, 1995 was within or outside the six-month probationary period. We ruled that November 15, 1995 was still within the six­ month probationary period. We reiterate our ruling in CALS Poultry Supply:\n(O)ur computation of the 6-month probationary period is reckoned from the date of appointment up to the same calendar date of the 6th month following. (italics supplied)\nIn short, since the number of days in each particular month was irrelevant, petitioner was still a probationary employee when respondent Middleby opted not to \"regularize\" him on November 20, 1996.\nPetitioner was hired on July 16, 2012 for a six-month probationary contract; thus, her probation should last until January 16, 2012, the same calendar date of the 6th month following July 16, 2012. Indubitably, following the principle in Alcira and CALS Poultry , petitioner was not yet a regular employee and was still on probation when Metrobank terminated her employment on January 15, 2013.\nAssuming arguendo that petitioner was already a regular employee on the day of her termination on January 15, 2013, Metrobank, still, had validly effected her dismissal from the service.\nIt is well settled that the usual two-notice rule does not apply when dismissal is brought about by the failure of an employee on probation to meet the standards of the employer. While it is already sufficient that a written notice is given to the probationary employee, within a reasonable time from the date of termination, Metrobank still applied the two-notice rule in favor of petitioner. Metrobank served on her a Show Cause Letter on January 2, 2013 informing her of her infractions and affording her the chance to explain her side within five days from notice. Finding petitioners explanation in her Letter dated January 9, 2013 unsatisfactory, Metrobank sent her a second notice dated January 14, 2013 informing her of her termination effective January 15, 2013. By all accounts, petitioner's dismissal from service was effected with the observance of due process. Thus, the Court finds no bad faith on the part of Metrobank in dismissing petitioner.\nIn Wise and Co., Inc. v. Wise & Co., Inc. Employees Union-NATU , the Court held:\nx x x it is the prerogative of management to regulate, according to its discretion and judgment, all aspects of employment. This flows from the established rule that labor law does not authorize the substitution of the judgment of the employer in the conduct of its business. Such management prerogative may be availed of without fear of any liability so long as it is exercised in good faith for the advancement of the employers' interest and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of employees under special laws or valid agreement and are not exercised in a malicious, harsh, oppressive, vindictive or wanton manner or out of malice or spite. (Citations omitted)\nAll told, petitioner's termination from employment was valid and considered as Metrobank's exercise of management prerogative.\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED .

{"id":949,"text":"FIRST DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 247976, May 14, 2021 ]\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. EDILBERTO MANUEL, JR. Y MANGALINDAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\nD E C I S I O N\nGESMUNDO, C.J.:\nConsidering that the accused herein knew at the time of the incident that the victim suffered from some form of mental retardation, yet the same did not deter him from pursuing his bestial desires, the law thus imposes upon him a higher penalty for his uncompromising carnal motivations.\nThe Case\nThis is an appeal from the Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 09562, promulgated on December 17, 2018, which affirmed with modification the January 31, 2017 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, XXX, Branch 36 (RTC), finding Edilberto Manuel, Jr. y Mangalindan (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Rape in Criminal Case No. 21532-2013-C.\nAntecedents\nAccused-appellant was charged with rape under the following allegations in the information, thus -\nThat [sometime] in January 2013 at [XXX] and within the jurisdiction of his Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge of AAA, a fifteen[-]year old female minor deprived of reason, in violation of the aforementioned law.\nThat in the commission of the offense offender knew of the mental retardation of complainant.\nACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.\nAccused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge and the case proceeded to trial. To prove its case, the prosecution presented the testimonies of the following: (1) AAA, the minor private complainant herself; (2) BBB, AAA's aunt (the sister of AAA's mother) and the person who took custody of AAA; (3) Dr. Roy Camarillo (Dr. Camarillo), the physician who approved the results of the physical examination conducted upon AAA; and (4) Dr. Joel Lazaro (Dr. Lazaro), a Development and Behavioral Pediatrician who diagnosed AAA with mental retardation.\nMeanwhile, the defense presented accused-appellant's testimony and that of his live-in partner, CCC, the biological mother of AAA.\nThe CA summarized the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses in this manner:\nAAA was born on March 11, 1997. Her biological mother is CCC and her birth certificate indicated that her father was unknown. When she was 6 years old, she was found to have a global pattern of developmental delay and had a developmental age of 3 to 3. years old. At 9 years old, she was diagnosed to have mental retardation with a developmental age of a 5-year old. On her follow-up visit at the age of 16 years old, she was diagnosed to have a developmental age of 5 to 5. years old. Initially, it was her grandparents who took care of her, but upon their death, BBB took over.\nAs aforesaid, accused-appellant is the live-in partner of CCC.\nAccording to AAA, sometime in January 2013, herein accused-appellant, whom the former referred to as \"Kuya Boy\" or \"Charles\" touched her vagina, inserted his penis into her vagina, and kissed her on the cheek and the lips. Thereafter, he hit her at her thighs.\nBecause of AAA's mental condition, which Dr. Lazaro explained in his testimony, the public prosecutor, in a sketch of a male person, made AAA identify the male body part which accused-appellant inserted in her vagina. AAA then pointed to the male genitalia and referred to it as \"itlog.\" When confronted with a female sketch, she was able to properly identify the vagina, and narrated that it was there where accused-appellant placed his \"itlog.\"\nAAA further testified that she lived in the same house with accused-appellant for quite some time; and that the latter repeatedly touched her private part. As accused-appellant threatened her, she did not report the incident to anyone. She was only 15 years old at the time of the incident.\nThe second witness, BBB testified that she took care of AAA since birth. Sometime in February 2013, she obtained information from her half­ sister's helper that she saw herein accused-appellant enter the room where AAA was lying on the bed and covered with a blanket; and that accused-appellant immediately locked the door thereafter. This led her to inquire from AAA about the incident, and the latter told her that accused-appellant inserted his finger into her private part and caressed it.\nBBB then reported the incident to a certain Colonel Lumbres. Then BBB, together with AAA and their house helper, went to the barangay hall where they assisted by Barangay Captain [YYY]. They were immediately referred to the officer of the Department of Social Welfare and Development Upon request by the Police Superintendent of the [XXX] Police Station, a medical examination was conducted upon AAA at the Camp [XXX].\nDr. Camarillo testified on the Medico-Legal Report and further alleged that there was no evident ana-genital injury, but clarified that the result does not exclude sexual abuse and that further investigation, such as careful questioning of the child is required.\nOn the other hand, the CA summarized the version of the defense in this manner:\nFor his part, accused-appellant vehemently denied the accusations hurled against him by the prosecution and raised the defense of denial. While he admitted that he knows AAA as the daughter of his live-in partner, CCC, he denied that he touched or molested AAA; and that AAA was not living with them and he never visited the latter.\nAccused-appellant narrated that, in January 2013, he was in the store that he manages with CCC, with their three store helpers. Nevertheless, he admitted that AAA would go to their house on Sundays before going to church.\nTo discredit AAA's testimony, accused-appellant contended that the stories were merely fabricated considering that CCC's family never approved of him and his relationship with CCC and that they even blamed him for the death of their parents.\nCCC's testimony corroborated accused-appellant's version of facts. According to CCC, it was not possible for accused-appellant to have committed the crime because he was always with her in their grocery store as he was the one in-charge of the inventory and the remittance of money to the bank. She admitted that her sister adopted her daughter, AAA, because she was not able to provide for her. Although she loves her daughter, she did not regain custody over her despite the fact that she already has the means to support her. The accusations against accused-appellant are merely ill-motivated because her family disapproved of her relationship with him.\nJudgment of the RTC\nAfter trial, the RTC found accused-appellant guilty of the crime charged. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the Court finds accused EDILBERTO MANUEL, JR. GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of RAPE defined and penalized under Article 266-A No. 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act (R.A) No. 8353 or the Anti-Rape Law of 1997 of the Revised Penal Code. He is ordered to suffer imprisonment of reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the victim in the amount of P50,000. by way of civil indemnity, P50,000. as moral damages, and P30,000. as exemplary damages.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe RTC gave credence to the testimony of AAA who positively identified accused-appellant as her abuser. It found the same to be straightforward, convincing, and consistent despite her mental deficiency. There was no tinge of revenge or rancor in her testimony. It held that the absence of any abrasions or injury on the genitalia of AAA is of no moment because such is not indispensable for a rape conviction. It refused to give weight to accused-appellant's defense of denial and imputation of ill motive. Lastly, the trial court ruled that the fact of AAA's mental's deficiency was well-established by competent medical evidence. Unperturbed, accused-appellant appealed his conviction.\nJudgment of the CA\nAs stated, the CA affirmed the RTC decision with modifications. It affirmed the conviction against accused-appellant for rape and the corresponding penalty but modified the amounts awarded and imposed legal interest. The fallo reads:\nWHEREFORE , the instant appeal is DENIED .\nThe January 31, 2017, Decision rendered by Branch 36 of the Regional Trial Court [XXX], Laguna, in Criminal Case No. 21532-2013-C is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION . Accused-appellant Edilberto Manuel, Jr. is sentenced to reclusion perpetua without eligibility of parole, and ordered to pay AAA: (1) P75,000. as civil indemnity; (2) P75,000. as moral damages; and (3) P75,000. as exemplary damages. All amounts due shall earn legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of this Decision until full payment.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe appellate court declared that it was not persuaded by accused-appellant's argument that the physical evidence does not support the charge of rape. ℒαwρhi৷ It noted that there was no definitive statement in the medico-legal report that AAA could not have been subjected to sexual abuse. It held that the credible disclosure of AAA that accused-appellant raped her is the most important proof of the commission of the crime. It found that there is no evidence that AAA was moved by any improper motive. It likewise rejected accused-appellant's defense of denial.\nHence, this appeal.\nAccused-appellant argues that the courts a quo gravely erred: (1) in giving credence to private complainant's testimony despite its failure to correspond with documentary evidence presented; and (2) in not considering his defense of denial. He asseverated that AAA was not able to detail how he had allegedly sexually abused her. All she did was to describe in general terms that he had inserted his penis into her vagina without narrating the circumstances leading to the incident. He highlights the fact no hymenal laceration or evident injury to AAA's private organ was noted in her medical examination. He stresses that with AAA's testimony discredited and the hatred that their family holds against him, his defense of denial and alibi should be considered.\nIssue\nInevitably, the issue here is whether the lower courts erred in convicting accused-appellant of the crime charged.\nRuling of the Court\nThe appeal fails to persuade.\nAt the onset, it must be noted that the information charged accused-appellant not only with rape, as punished by Article 266-A(l)(b), but also with the allegation that the accused-appellant knew of the mental retardation of complainant at the time of the commission of the offense. This, coupled with a review of the records and the Court's decision in People v. Castillo, compels the Court to convict accused-appellant with qualified statutory rape, despite the sub-silencio treatment of both trial and appellate courts on the qualifying circumstance alleged in the information.\nAccused-appellant's guilt for the generic crime of rape was proven beyond reasonable doubt.\nArt. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) provides that rape is committed:\n1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:\nThe elements of rape under Art. 266-A of the RPC are: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation; or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is under twelve years of age.\nIn People v. Castillo, the Court expressly held that \"sexual intercourse with a mental retardate whose mental age is below 12 years old constitutes statutory rape,\" viz .:\nIn the 2017 cases of People v. Deniega and People v. Niebres, however, the Court held that sexual intercourse with a mental retardate whose mental age is below 12 years old constitutes statutory rape. These cases cite People v. Quintos, which provided for the distinctions between \"deprived of reason,\" \"demented,\" and \"mental retardation.\" To quote:\nThe term, \"deprived of reason,\" is associated with insanity or madness. A person deprived of reason has mental abnormalities that affect his or her reasoning and perception of reality and, therefore, his or her capacity to resist, make decisions, and give consent.\nThe term \"demented,\" refers to a person who suffers from a mental condition called dementia. Dementia refers to the deterioration or loss of mental functions such as memory, learning, speaking, and social condition, which impairs one's independence in everyday activities.\nWe are aware that the terms, \"mental retardation\" or \"intellectual disability,\" had been classified under \"deprived of reason.\" The terms, \"deprived of reason\" and \"demented,\" however, should be differentiated from the term, \"mentally retarded\" or \"intellectually disabled.\" An intellectually disabled person is not necessarily deprived of reason or demented. This court had even ruled that they may be credible witnesses. However, his or her maturity is not there despite the physical age. He or she is deficient in general mental abilities and has an impaired conceptual, social, and practical functioning relative to his or her age, gender, and peers. Because of such impairment, he or she does not meet the \"socio-cultural standards of personal independence and social responsibility.\"\nThus, a person with a chronological age of 7 years and a nonnal mental age is as capable of making decisions and giving consent as a person with a chronological age of 35 and a mental age of 7. Both are considered incapable of giving rational consent because both are not yet considered to have reached the level of maturity that gives them the capability to make rational decisions, especially on matters involving sexuality. Decision-making is a function of the mind. Hence, a person's capacity to decide whether to give consent or to express resistance to an adult activity is determined not by his or her chronological age but by his or her mental age. Therefore, in determining whether a person is \"twelve (12) years of age\" under Article 266-A(l)(d), the interpretation should be in accordance with either the chronological age of the child if he or she is not suffering from intellectual disability, or the mental age if intellectual disability is established. (emphases supplied and citations omitted)\nFollowing these developments, it is clear that as regards rape of a mental retardate, the Court now holds that, following People v. Quintos, when the victim is a mental retardate whose mental age is that of a person below 12 years old, the rape should be classified as statutory rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the RPC, as amended.\nTo this end, for a successful prosecution of the crime of rape as punished under Art. 266-A, paragraph(l)(d), the following essential elements must be alleged and proven: the fact of sexual congress between the rapist and his victim, and the latter's mental age is that of a person below 12 years old. Both facts were proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.\nHere, it was undisputedly proven that AAA, at the age of 16 years old, was diagnosed to have a developmental age of 5 to 5. years old. This was testified to by her doctor as well as her family members.\nFurther, her testimony on her experience under the hands of accused-appellant, whom she called \"Kuya Boy\" or \"Charles,\" convinces this Court that accused-appellant successfully had carnal knowledge of AAA. During her direct examination, the public prosecutor presented AAA with a sketch of a male person. AAA pointed to the male genitalia and referred to it as \"itlog.\" When confronted with the sketch of a female person, she properly identified the vagina and narrated that it was there where accused-appellant placed his \"itlog.\"\nThe testimony of AAA is clear. Accused-appellant succeeded in having carnal knowledge of AAA when he inserted his \"itlog\" inside her vagina. The fact that AAA was not able to detail the circumstances leading to the incident is of no moment, for the element of rape that must be proven by her testimony is the fact of carnal knowledge. She testified on this score definitively, upon which the trial court convicted accused-appellant and the CA affirmed said conviction.\nIn an attempt to denigrate AAA's testimony, accused-appellant argues that her testimony was not supported by the medico-legal report which provided that there was no hymenal laceration or evident injury in AAA's private organ, internal or external. Suffice it to say that this Court has repeatedly held \"xxx that the absence of physical injuries or fresh lacerations does not negate rape, and although medical results may not indicate physical abuse or hymenal lacerations, rape can still be established since medical findings or proof of injuries are not among the essential elements in the prosecution for rape.\" Besides, the medico-legal report itself expressly stated that its results do not exclude sexual abuse.\nMoreover, it is a general principle of law that factual findings of the trial court, including its assessment as to the credibility of the witnesses, are not disturbed on appeal unless the trial court is perceived to have overlooked, misunderstood or misinterpreted certain facts or circumstances of weight which, if properly considered, would have materially affected the outcome of the case. This Court finds that there is no compelling reason to disturb the factual findings as well as their assessment of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, as the same came from the straightforward testimony of AAA.\nIn the face of AAA's testimony, accused-appellant's defense of denial and alibi fails. There is no showing that she was impelled by any improper motive. As the Court previously held, \"considering the mental retardation of AAA, [W]e find it highly improbable that she would fabricate the rape charge against appellant. It is likewise unlikely that she was instructed into accusing appellant given her limited intellect Due to her mental condition, only a very traumatic experience would leave lasting impression on her so that she would be able to recall it when asked.\"\nThe Court inevitably concludes that, indeed, accused-appellant had carnal knowledge with AAA.\nThe prosecution was also successful in proving the qualifying circumstance that transforms the offense into qualified statutory rape.\nAs regards the qualifying circumstances stated in the information, a review of the records compels the Court to conclude that the prosecution was able to prove the qualifying circumstance that would change the nature of the offense to qualified statutory rape.\nArt. 266-B of the RPC provides that the death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating\/qualifying circumstances:\nx x x x\n(10) When the offender knew the mental disability, emotional disorder and\/or physical handicap of the offended party at the time of the commission of the crime. (emphasis supplied)\nHere, it was established that accused-appellant is the live-in partner of the biological mother of AAA. Further, while accused-appellant denied that he was living in the same house as AAA, he admitted, nevertheless, that AAA visited their house every Sunday before going to church. To the mind of the Court, his relationship with AAA's biological mother, as well as the frequency of AAA's visits and meetings with accused-appellant every Sunday, is sufficient to clothe him of awareness, if not knowledge, of the condition of AAA.\nIn People v. Dela Paz, the Court imputed knowledge of the victim's mental condition to the accused therein considering that accused frequented the house of the victim and was the drinking buddy of the victim's brother. There, the Court was satisfied that their interactions during those encounters would have informed therein accused of the mental status of the victim.\nHere, it is impossible for the accused-appellant to not have known the mental state and condition of AAA. His intimate relationship with her biological mother, as well as AAA's frequent and scheduled visits every Sunday to his home, are sufficient proof to establish his culpability for the crime of qualified rape. Truly, accused-appellant cannot feign ignorance of the mental condition of AAA.\nThe Proper Penalty\nUnder Art. 266-B of the RPC, qualified statutory rape shall be punished by death. However, due to the passage of Republic Act No. 9346, The Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines, the penalty is automatically reduced to reclusion perpetua . Furthermore, the penalty of reclusion perpetua should be qualified by the phrase \"without eligibility for parole\" pursuant to the Court's guidelines in A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC.\nLastly, following the Court's ruling in People v. Jugueta, the Court orders accused-appellant to pay the following amounts: P100,000. as civil indemnity, P100,000. as moral damages, P100,000. as exemplary damages; and interest imposed on the said amounts at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this decision until fully paid.\nWHEREFORE , the Court DISMISSES the appeal; FINDS accused-appellant Edilberto Manuel, Jr. y Mangalindan GUILTY of Qualified Statutory Rape, as defined and punished under Article 266-A(l)(d), in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code; IMPOSES the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole; and ORDERS accused-appellant to PAY the following amounts: P100,000. as civil indemnity, P100,000. as moral damages, P100,000. as exemplary damages and to PAY interest on the said amounts at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.\nSO ORDERED.\nCaguioa, Carandang, Gaerlan, and Rosario,* JJ., concur.","label":[[17,32,"CASE_NUM"],[34,46,"PROM_DATE"],[49,74,"INS"],[100,135,"PERSON"],[172,180,"PERSON"],[553,576,"CASE_NUM"],[593,610,"PROM_DATE"],[682,702,"INS"],[720,723,"INS"],[734,769,"PERSON"],[832,862,"CASE_NUM"],[1698,1711,"PERSON"],[1717,1726,"PERSON"],[1828,1839,"PERSON"],[1845,1851,"PERSON"],[2074,2076,"INS"],[3098,3104,"PERSON"],[4708,4717,"PERSON"],[4990,4992,"INS"],[6517,6520,"INS"],[6538,6541,"INS"],[6704,6726,"PERSON"],[6793,6841,"STA"],[6857,6884,"RA"],[7159,7162,"INS"],[7860,7862,"INS"],[7878,7880,"INS"],[7894,7897,"INS"],[8200,8220,"INS"],[8239,8269,"CASE_NUM"],[8327,8348,"PERSON"],[10309,10322,"STA"],[10559,10567,"PERSON"],[10868,10904,"STA"],[10906,10909,"STA"],[11068,11078,"STA"],[13916,13929,"STA"],[14480,14493,"STA"],[14517,14520,"INS"],[14615,14625,"STA"],[15215,15222,"PERSON"],[16077,16079,"INS"],[17223,17228,"INS"],[18340,18345,"INS"],[18498,18508,"STA"],[19405,19413,"PERSON"],[20183,20204,"STA"],[20290,20311,"RA"],[21046,21081,"PERSON"],[21184,21223,"STA"],[21602,21609,"PERSON"],[21611,21620,"PERSON"],[21622,21629,"PERSON"],[21635,21642,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

Petitioner likewise submitted documents in support of its administrative protest on April 12, 2013. Due to the alleged inaction of respondent on its protest, petitioner filed a Petition for Review on November 7, 2013 to the CTA in Division.\nOn December 16, 2013, the CIR filed its Answer arguing that the assessment has become final, executory, and demandable; therefore, the CTA no longer has jurisdiction over the petition. The CIR likewise raised that tax assessments made by examiners are presumed correct and in good faith.\nThereafter, pre-trial and trial ensued.\nOn April 10, 2014, upon motion of petitioner, Enrico T. Pizarro was commissioned by the Court as the Independent Certified Public Accountant for the case.\nDuring trial, petitioner presented Leah Laxamana and Enrico T. Pizarro as its witnesses. On the other hand, the CIR presented as witnesses, Bernard R. Bugauisan and Bacolor D. Yambing.\nThe CTA declared the case submitted for decision on July 20, 2015, after the filing of the parties' respective Memoranda.\nRuling of the CTA Second Division\nOn July 1, 2016, the CTA Second Division rendered its Decision dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction.\nAccording to the CTA Second Division, there was no disputed assessment in this case because petitioner's protest against the FAN and FLD were filed out of time. The CTA Second Division found that petitioner received the FAN and FLD on January 14, 2013 but only filed the protest on February 14, 2013 or 31 days from the receipt thereof. The National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) and Revenue Regulation No. 12-99 are clear that the FAN and FLD should have been disputed within 30 days. The CTA Second Division concluded that the failure to file a protest on time made the assessment final, executory, and demandable.\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration. However, the CTA Second Division denied the same through a Resolution dated August 22, 2016. Hence, petitioner elevated the case to the CTA En Banc.\nRuling of the CTA En Banc\nOn February 12, 2018, the CTA En Banc issued its Decision affirming the ruling of the CTA Second Division.\nThe CTA En Banc concurred with the CTA Second Division that the tax court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal a decision of, or inaction by, the OR only in cases involving disputed assessments, among others. In this case, petitioner was not able to controvert the subject tax assessments because it failed to file its administrative protest on time. Hence, there is no \"disputed assessment\" to which the CTA has jurisdiction to review.\nHowever, in Presiding Justice Roman G. Del Rosario's (Presiding Justice Del Rosario) dissenting opinion on the CTA En Banc's decision, he submitted that the FLD with Details of Discrepancies and Assessment Notices issued against petitioner are void. Presiding Justice Del Rosario noted that the revenue officers who conducted the examination of petitioner's books of accounts and other accounting records were not authorized by a valid LOA.\nTaking a hint from the dissenting opinion of Presiding Justice Del Rosario, petitioner moved for the reconsideration of the CTA En Banc's decision and raised for the first time that the FAN and FLD issued against it were null and void because of the lack of authority of the revenue officers who conducted the audit. However, the motion was denied in a Resolution dated July 24, 2018. According to the CTA En Banc, petitioner's belated attempt to question the authority of the revenue officers was fatal to its case.\nUndaunted, petitioner filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court reiterating that the assessment made against it was null and void. Petitioner explained that the tax audit was commenced through LOA-039-2010-00000072 dated September 29, 2010 and signed by CMC Regional Director of Quezon City, Jonas Amora. The LOA authorized revenue officer Ruby Cacdac (Cacdac) and group supervisor Bernardo Andaya (Andaya) to examine the books of accounts of petitioner for taxable year 2009. However, contrary to the LOA, it was not Cacdac who conducted the audit, but it was revenue officer Bernard Bagauisan (Bagauisan) who examined the books of accounts of petitioner pursuant to BIR Memorandum of Assignment No. 039-1011-00340 dated October 28, 2011 and signed by revenue district officer Clavelina Nacar (Nacar). According to petitioner, while at the onset, the tax investigation was valid pursuant to LOA-039-2010-00000072, this became irregular and fatally defective later when another revenue officer was tasked to conduct the audit without a valid LOA. Petitioner insists that any reassignment or transfer of cases to another revenue officer shall require the issuance of a new LOA. Without a new LOA, the assessment against petitioner was void ab initio.\nIn its Comment, the CIR, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), countered that the tax assessments against petitioner are valid and binding.\nIssue\nThe issue in this case is whether the assessment conducted against petitioner was null and void.\nRuling of the Court\nThe petition is meritorious.\nRevenue Officer Bagauisan who conducted the audit of petitioner's hooks of accounts was not authorized pursuant to a valid LOA.\nA perusal of the records of the case discloses that electronic LOA SN: eLA201000017400 LOA-039-2010-00000072 issued against petitioner specifically authorized revenue officer Cacdac and group supervisor Andaya, to examine the books of accounts of petitioner for taxable year 2009, to wit:\nSIR\/MADAM\/GENTLEMEN:\nThe bearer(s) hereof, RO-RUBY CACDAC\/GS-BARNARDO ANDAYA of Revenue District No. 039 of Quezon City is\/are authorized to examine your books of accounts and other accounting records for INTERNAL REVENUE TAXES for the period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 pursuant to REGULAR AUDIT PROGRAM FOR 2010. The Revenue Officer(s) identified herein are provided with the necessary identification card(s) which shall be presented to you upon request.\nx x x x\nVery truly yours,\nSgd. JONAS DP. AMORA OIC REGIONAL DIRECTOR QUEZON CITY (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)\nHowever, it appeared that Cacdac was not the revenue officer who actually conducted the audit of petitioner's books of accounts. ℒαwρhi৷ It was revenue officer Bagauisan who audited petitioner by virtue of a memorandum of assignment signed by revenue district officer Nacar, which reads:\nMEMORANDUM TO:\nRevenue Officer(s): BERNARD R. BAGAUISAN\nGroup Supervisor: NORA U. FLORES\nSubject: Audit\/Verification of the All Internal Revenue Tax Liabilities for Taxable Year\/Period 2009 of HIMLAYANG FILIPINO PLANS, INC. with TIN #000­845-616-000 pursuant to eLA No. 00000072 dated September 29, 2010.\nReferred\/Returned to you is the subject case\/docket for:\n[x] Continuation of the audit\/investigation to replace the previously assigned Revenue Officer(s) who transferred to another district office.\nx x x x\nFor your information and strict compliance.\nSgd. CLAYELINA S. NACAR Revenue District Officer (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)\nThe reassignment of the examination of petitioner's books of accounts pursuant to electronic LOA SN: eLA201000017400 LOA-039-2010-00000072 from revenue officer Cacdac to revenue officer Bagauisan necessitates the issuance of a new LOA. This is clear under Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 43-90 or \"An Amendment of Revenue Memorandum Order No. 37-90 Prescribing Revised Policy Guidelines for Examination of Returns and Issuance of Letters of Authority to Audit,\" which provides that:\nC. Other policies for issuance of L\/As.\nx x x x\n5. Any re-assignment\/transfer of cases to another RO(s), and revalidation of L\/As which have already expired, shall require the issuance of a new L\/A, with the corresponding notation thereto, including the previous L\/A number and date of issue of said L\/As.\nHere, there was no new LOA issued naming Bagauisan as the new revenue officer who would conduct the examination of petitioner's books of accounts. The authority of Bagauisan is anchored only upon the memorandum of assignment signed by revenue district officer Nacar.\nSection 13 of the NIRC requires that a revenue officer must be validly authorized before conducting an audit of a taxpayer:\nSection 13. Authority of a Revenue Officer. - Subject to the rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, a Revenue Officer assigned to perform assessment functions in any district may, pursuant to a Letter of Authority issued by the Revenue Regional Director, examine taxpayers within the jurisdiction of the district in order to collect the correct amount of tax, or to recommend the assessment of any deficiency tax due in the same manner that the said acts could have been performed by the Revenue Regional Director himself. (Emphasis supplied)\nIn addition, under RMO No. 43-90, only the following officers may validly issue a LOA:\nD. Preparation and issuance of L\/As.\nx x x x\n4. For the proper monitoring and coordination of the issuance of Letter of Authority, the only BIR officials authorized to issue and sign Letters of Authority are the Regional Directors, the Deputy Commissioners and the Commissioner. For the exigencies of the service, other officials may be authorized to issue and sign Letters of Authority but only upon prior authorization by the Commissioner himself. (Emphasis supplied)\nThus, revenue officer Bagauisan is not authorized by a new LOA to conduct an audit of petitioner's books of accounts for taxable year 2009.\nThe lack of a valid LOA authorizing Revenue Officer Bagauisan to conduct an audit on petitioner makes the assessment void.\nA LOA is the authority given to the appropriate revenue officer assigned to perform assessment functions. It empowers or enables said revenue officer to examine the books of account and other accounting records of a taxpayer for the purpose of collecting the correct amount of tax.\nIn Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sony Philippines, Inc. the Court nullified the deficiency VAT assessment made against Sony Philippines because the revenue officers went beyond their authority when they based the assessment on records from January to March 1998 or using the fiscal year which ended in March 31, 1998 when the LOA covered only \"the period 1997 and unverified prior years\". According to the Court:\nClearly, there must be a grant of authority before any revenue officer can conduct an examination or assessment. ℒαwρhi৷ Equally important is that the revenue officer so authorized must not go beyond the authority given. In the absence of such an authority, the assessment or examination is a nullity. (Emphasis supplied)\nIn Medicard Philippines, Inc. v. CIR, the Court nullified the deficiency VAT assessment against Medicard Philippines because there was no LOA issued by the CIR prior to the issuance of PAN and FAN. The Letter of Notice earlier sent to Medicard Philippines was not validly converted into a LOA. According to the Court in Medicard Philippines:\nWhat is crucial is whether the proceedings that led to the issuance of VAT deficiency assessment against MEDICARD had the prior approval and authorization from the CIR or her duly authorized representatives. Not having authority to examine MEDICARD in the first place, the assessment issued by the CIR is inescapably void. (Emphasis supplied)\nHere, as comprehensively discussed, there was no new LOA issued by the CIR or his duly authorized representative giving revenue officer Bagauisan the power to conduct an audit on petitioner's books of accounts for taxable year 2009. The importance of the lack of the revenue officer's authority to conduct an audit cannot be overemphasized because it goes into the validity of the assessment. The lack of authority of the revenue officers is tantamount to the absence of a LOA itself which results to a void assessment. Being a void assessment, the same bears no fruit.\nLastly, as stated in Presiding Justice Del Rosario's dissenting opinion on the CTA En Banc's decision, the failure of petitioner to raise at the earliest opportunity, the lack of the revenue officer's authority, does not precluded the Court from considering the same because the said issue goes into the intrinsic validity of the assessment itself.\nWHEREFORE , the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby GRANTED .

{"id":951,"text":"THIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 214270, May 12, 2021 ]\nJAY V. SABADO, PETITIONER, VS. TINA MARIE L. SABADO, FOR HERSELF AND HER MINOR CHILDREN, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nHERNANDO, J.:\nOn appeal is the May 29, 2014 Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 100631, affirming the January 30, 2013 Decision and Permanent Protection Order of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 136 of Makati City in Civil Case No. 12-963 which ordered petitioner Jay Villanueva Sabado (Jay) to stay away from respondent Tina Marie L. Sabado (Tina) at a distance of 200 meters and to grant monthly support of P100,000. to Tina and their minor children.\nThe Factual Antecedents:\nA Petition for Temporary and Permanent Protection. Order, Support and Support Pendente Lite was filed by Tina against her husband Jay. Tina and Jay were married on July 24, 1999 at Nuestra Sra. De Gracia Parish, Guadalupe, Makati City. Their marriage bore two children born on March 2, 2000 and on July 3, 2005. Tina is a bank employee while Jay works overseas as a ship captain. He has an estimated monthly income of $6,500.. During their marriage, they acquired the following real properties: (1) a 100-sqm parcel of land in Mandaluyong City; and (2) a condominium unit in California Garden Square worth P1,650,000..\nTina alleged that she and Jay would quarrel often over petty things, even during her pregnancy. She claimed that Jay was a controlling husband who would easily get irritated if she expressed her opinions. He would also accuse her of having an affair and throw a fit of jealousy, even if he had no basis for such accusation. At one point, Tina and the children were allegedly kicked out by Jay from their conjugal home. He told them to stay with Tina's mother in Makati City. Jay also publicly humiliated Tina by telling her \"maghiwalay na tayo\" in front of her officemates, while demanding for an annulment. Tina also learned that their community funds were being spent on Jay's mistress.\nThere came a time when Jay abandoned Tina and their children, depriving them of financial support. By February 2012, the monthly allotment from Jay which previously amounted to $4,000. was reduced to $2,500.. Jay also stopped visiting their children. Tina tried to contact Jay numerous times to settle their issues but her efforts were futile. She even reached out to her mother-in-law but the latter refused to intervene. As a result of Jay's abandonment and utter disregard for his family, Tina suffered psychological and emotional abuse.\nThus, Tina prayed for the issuance of a Temporary Protection Order (TPO), the grant of P120,000. monthly support to be remitted automatically by Jay's employer, and the eventual issuance of a Permanent Protection Order (PPO).\nOn October 22, 2012, a TPO was issued by the trial court in favor of Tina, the pertinent portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE , the Court issues the following Temporary Protection Order (effective for a period of 30 days from service on the respondent and deemed automatically renewed every 30 days thereafter until the disposition of this case):\nThe court orders JAY VILLANUEVA SABADO to stay away at a distance of 200 meters from petitioner Tina Marie L. Sabado and desist from publicly humiliating her and other forms of abuse.\nThe respondent is given five days from notice within which to file opposition.\nIF THE RESPONDENT APPEARS WITHOUT COUNSEL ON THE DATE OF THE PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE AND HEARING ON THE MERITS ON THE ISSUANCE OF A PERMANENT PROTECTION ORDER, WHICH IS HEREBY SET ON JANUARY 17, 2013 AT 3:00 O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON, THE COURT SHALL NOT RESCHEDULE NOR POSTPONE THE PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE AND HEARING BUT SHALL APPOINT A LAWYER FOR THE RESPONDENT AND IMMEDIATELY PROCEED WITH THE HEARING.\nIF THE RESPONDENT FAILS TO APPEAR ON THE DATE OF THE PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE AND HEARING ON THE MERITS DESPITE PROPER NOTICE, THE COURT SHALL ALLOW EX PARTE PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE BY THE PETITIONER AND RENDER JUDGMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE PLEADINGS AND EVIDENCE ON RECORD. NO DELEGATION OF THE RECEPTION OF EVIDENCE SHALL BE ALLOWED.\nThe Court directs the immediate issuance of the corresponding notice.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe court sheriff made several attempts to personally serve the summons, petition, and TPO to Jay at his address but the security guard said he was not around. He also tried to serve them at the office of his employer, only to be told that appellant was abroad for deployment.\nOn November 16, 2012, Atty. Gary O. Palmero (Atty. Palmero), counsel of Jay in a criminal case for violation of Republic Act No. 9262 (RA 9262), went to Branch 136 and received a copy of the Order and Petition as evidenced by the latter's signature therein.\nOn January 17, 2013, Jay filed an Entry of Appearance with Opposition to the Issuance of Permanent Protection Order where he asserted that he was merely a chief officer and not a ship captain. He also claimed that the couple acquired four (4) properties during their marriage, and that the condominium unit and parking slot are under the name of Tina. Although he admitted that he and Tina had disagreements, he denied humiliating her in public in the presence of her officemates. In truth, he has been a good provider for his family, as he sent his children to good schools.\nIn fact, his Certificate of Salary and Allowance from 2005-2012 show that Tina is still the named allottee who receives his remittances in the Philippines. Thus, he prayed for 1) the lifting of the TPO; 2) the denial of the issuance of PPO; 3) the determination of support and support pendente lite; and 4) relieving the respondent from posting of bond.\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court:\nOn January 25, 2013, the trial court issued an Order denying the admission of appellant's Opposition for having been belatedly filed two (2) months after the issuance of the TPO. It held that under Administrative Matter (AM) No. 04-10-11-SC, Jay only has a non-extendible period of five (5) days within which to file his answer or opposition. His failure to do so allowed the court to issue the corresponding order as warranted y the facts alleged in the Petition. Thus, having received a copy of the order and TPO on November 16, 2012 through Atty. Palmero, the filing of Jay's opposition on January 13, 2013 was already too late.\nOn January 30, 2013, the trial court issued a PPO in favor of Tina. It pointed out that Jay already waived his opportunity to oppose the petition for his failure to file the necessary pleading on time. Consequently, it held that Tina was subjected to psychological and emotional abuse, as well as deprivation of financial support. Thus, Jay was ordered to stay away at a distance of 200 meters from Tina and the children and to pay a monthly support of P100,000..\nAggrieved, Jay elevated the case to the CA arguing that: (1) Tina failed to prove the necessity for a protection order; (2) Tina failed to prove the amount of support needed and Jay's capacity to provide the same; and (3) the trial court erred in rendering judgment despite the Improper service of summons.\nRuling of the Court of Appeals:\nThe CA affirmed the findings of the trial court. It held that there was no improper service of summons. The notice received by counsel representing a party in an action in court is equivalent to notice to the party himself. Consequently, when Atty. Palmero received the copy of the Order and TPO, Jay was considered to have been duly notified as well. Indeed, there was no deprivation of Jay's right to present his side. Unfortunately, Jay's opposition was only filed two (2) months after the service of the order and TPO. Indubitably, it was filed beyond the non-extendible five (5)-day period. Thus, the trial court correctly denied the admission of Jay's opposition.\nDiscontented, Jay elevated the case before Us, adopting the issues that he had raised in the CA. He questions the validity of the service of summons. He claims that from August 7, 2012 up to January 5, 2013, he was out of the Philippines for his overseas work. Hence, Tina should have resorted to substituted service or extraterritorial service of summons if personal service could not be effected, in accordance with Section 16, A.M. No. 04-10-11-SC and Rule 14 of the Rules of Court. He also points out that the Sheriff's Return did not specify the dates the latter went to his residence, thereby fatal to the acquisition of jurisdiction over his person. Consequently, the proceedings before the trial court are null and void.\nOur Ruling\nThe Petition is without merit.\nWe have clarified the nature and purpose of summons vis-a-vis a TPO in Pavlow v. Mendenilla, to wit:\nSummons is a procedural tool. It is a writ by which the defendant is notified that an action was brought against him or her. ℒαwρhi৷ In an action in personam, brought to enforce personal rights and obligations, jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is mandatory. In such actions, therefore, summonses serve not only to notify the defendant of the filing of an action, but also to enable acquisition of jurisdiction over his person.\nA protection order is not a procedural mechanism, which is imperative for the progression of an initiated action. Rather, it is itself a substantive relief which \"prevent[s] further acts of violence against a woman or her child specified in Section 5 of [the Anti-VAWC Law] and granting other necessary relief.\" x x x\nx x x x\nx x x [S]ummons and temporary protection orders are entirely different judicial issuances. It is true that the latter also serves the purpose of conveying information. However, this information pertains not to the filing of an action but merely to the schedule of an upcoming hearing. The similarities of a summons and a protection order begin and end with their informative capacity. At no point does the Anti-VAWC Law intimate that the temporary protection order is the means for acquiring jurisdiction over the person of the respondent.\nSection 15 of the Anti-VAWC Law's reference to \"immediate personal service\" is an incident of the underlying urgency which compelled the ex parte issuance of a protection order. It should not be construed as a restriction on the manner of acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of the respondent. Otherwise, far from relieving a manifest urgency, it stifles a civil action for the issuance of a protection order right at the moment of its initiation. Construed as such, a temporary protection order is twisted to a shrewdly convenient procedural tool for defeating the very purposes for which it was issued in the first place.\nx x x x\nSection 1 of A.M. No. 04-10-11-SC expressly states that while it governs petitions for the issuance of protection orders under the Anti-VAWC Law, \"[t]he Rules of Court shall apply suppletorily.\" In the silence of A.M. No. 04-10-11-SC, service of summons - the means established by the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure for informing defendants and\/or respondents of the filing of adverse actions, and for the acquisition of jurisdiction over their persons - remains efficacious. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nClearly, jurisdiction over the person of the respondent in a petition for TPO!PPO under RA 9262 can be acquired through any of the means of serving summons under the Rules of Court. In an action in personam such as a petition for TPO\/PPO under RA 9262, the purpose of summons is two-fold: (1) to notify the defendant that an action has been brought against him; and (2) to acquire jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. When the defendant does not voluntarily submit to the court's jurisdiction or when there is no valid service of summons, any judgment of the court which has no jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is null and void. This underscores the importance of the proof of service of summons under the Rules of Court:\nThe proof of service of a summons shall be made in writing by the server and shall set forth the manner, place, and date of service; shall specify any papers which have been served with the process and the name of the person who received the same; and shall be sworn to when made by a person other than a sheriff or his deputy.\nIn the case at bar, the sheriff attempted to personally serve the summons, petition, and TPO in Jay's residence and place of employment as per the Sheriffs Return:\nTHIS IS TO CERTIFY [that] on several occasions the undersigned tried to serve personally upon respondent JAY VILLANUEVA SABADO a copy of herein summons together with the petition and its annexes as well as the copy of TEMPORARY PROTECTION ORDER dated October 22, 2012 issued by the Honorable Court in the above-entitled case, at the stated address x x x but to no avail for the reason that said respondent were out of his place according to the Guard on Duty.\nThat on October 30, the undersigned went at the office of respondent at ELMIRA SHIPPING PHILS., INC. x x x as per information given by Ms. Malou, an employee of Elmitra [sic] Shipping Phils. Inc., that according to her the said respondent were on Board, but according to her she did not known [sic] when he [sic] coming back.\nIT IS FURTHER CERTIFIED, that on November 16, 2012 at around 4:05 pm the counsel of respondent, Atty. Gary O. Palmero, arrived at the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 136, and he received a copy of the Court Order and the Petition for his client.\nWHEREFORE , the herein Summons and Temporary Protection Order are hereby returned to this Honorable Court of origin for its record and information.\nHowever, records show that Jay was out of the country from August 7, 2012 to January 5, 2013 due to his overseas employment. Since personal service could not be effected upon him, summons should be served through substituted service, extraterritorial service, or by publication in accordance with Sections 7, 15 and 16, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court:\nSection 7. Substituted service. - If, for justifiable causes, the defendant cannot be served within a reasonable time as provided in the preceding section, service may be effected (a) by leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's residence with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein, or (b) by leaving the copies at defendant's office or regular place of business with some competent person in charge thereof.\nSection 15. Extraterritorial service. - When the defendant does not reside and is not found in the Philippines, and the action affects the personal status of the plaintiff or relates to, or the subject of which is, property within the Philippines, in which the defendant has or claims a lien or interest, actual or contingent, or in which the relief demanded consists, wholly or in part, in excluding the defendant from any interest therein, or the property of the defendant has been attached within the Philippines, service may, by leave of court, be effected out of the Philippines by personal service as under section 6; or by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in such places and for such time as the court may order, in which case a copy of the summons and order of the court shall be sent by registered mail to the last known address of the defendant, or in any other manner the court may deem sufficient. Any order granting such leave shall specify a reasonable time, which shall not be less than sixty (60) days after notice, within which the defendant must answer.\nSection 16. Residents temporarily out of the Philippines. - When any action is commenced against a defendant who ordinarily resides within the Philippines, but who is temporarily out of it, service may, by leave of court, be also effected out of the Philippines, as under the preceding section. (Emphases supplied)\nNotably, none of these modes of service were resorted to by Tina. While the CA is correct in quoting GCP-Manny Transport Services, Inc. v. Prinsipe that notice to counsel is equivalent to notice to client, the very same case also states that it is notice sent to counsel of record which is binding upon the client. In the case at hand, Atty. Palmero was Jay's counsel in a separate criminal case filed against the latter for violation of RA 9262 pending at that time before Branch 140 of the RTC of Makati. Therefore, Jay had no counsel of record yet with Branch 136 of the RTC of Makati at the time Atty. Palmero received the copy of the order and TPO.\nGranting arguendo that Jay knew of the pending TPO case against him, whether through Atty. Palmero or another person, the requirement of summons cannot be dispensed with. Jurisdiction over the person of the defendant cannot be acquired notwithstanding his knowledge of the pendency of a case against him, unless he was validly served with summons. Thus, serving the order and TPO to Atty. Palmero cannot be considered a valid service of summons.\nHowever, We note that Jay voluntarily submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the trial court when he filed the Entry of Appearance with Opposition to the Issuance of the Permanent Protection Order on January 17, 2013. By seeking affirmative relief in his opposition without objecting to the jurisdiction of the trial court, he thereby voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction.\nIn effect, this cured the invalid service of summons. In a catena of cases, this Court has ruled that voluntary appearance by the defendant results to his submission to the court's jurisdiction. In G.V. Florida Transport, Inc. v. Tiara Commercial Corporation, we held that:\nThere is voluntary appearance when a party, without directly assailing the court's lack of jurisdiction, seeks affirmative relief from the court. When a party appears before the court without qualification, he or she is deemed to have waived his or her objection regarding lack of jurisdiction due to improper service of summons. When a defendant, however, appears before the court for the specific purpose of questioning the court's jurisdiction over him or her, this is a special appearance and does not vest the court with jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)\nFrias v. Alcayde instructs that -\nWhen a defendant voluntarily appears, he is deemed to have submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court. This is not, however, always the case. Admittedly, and without subjecting himself to the court's jurisdiction, the defendant in an action can, by special appearance object to the court's assumption on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. If he so wishes to assert this defense, he must do so seasonably by motion for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of the court, otherwise, he shall be deemed to have submitted himself to that jurisdiction. (Emphases supplied)\nMoreover, Navale v. Court of Appeals, holds that:\nDefects of summons are cured by voluntary appearance and by the filing of an answer to the complaint. A defendant [cannot] be permitted to speculate upon the judgment of the court by objecting to the court's jurisdiction over its person if the judgment is adverse to it, and acceding to jurisdiction over its person if and when the judgment sustains its defense.\nClearly, the trial court acquired jurisdiction over Jay through his voluntary appearance when he sought the lifting of the TPO and the denial of the issuance of PPO in his opposition, without raising the issue of lack of jurisdiction over his person. By such conduct, he can no longer subsequently object to the court's jurisdiction.\nWHEREFORE , the petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.

{"id":952,"text":"FIRST DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 200671, May 14, 2021 ]\nPHILIPPINE SAVINGS BANK, PETITIONER, VS. AMELITA HIPOLITO, ALEX HIPOLITO, AND JOHN DOE, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nCARANDANG, J.:\nIn this Petition for Certoriari under Rule 45, petitioner Philippine Savings Banks (PSB) assails the Decision dated June 27, 2011 and the Resolution dated February 21, 2012 of the Court of Appeals (CA) denying reconsideration in CA-G.R. SP No. 94151. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision dated March 16, 2006 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasay City, which affirmed the Decision dated April 29, 2005 of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) in Civil Case No. 51804 CFM finding respondents liable to pay penalties, liquidated damages, attorney's fees, and costs of suit.\nAntecedents\nOn March 1, 2002, respondents executed in favor of Nissan Gallery - Ortigas (Dealer) a Promissory Note with Chattel Mortgage for P697,860. payable in 36 months with a monthly amortization of P19,385. to be paid beginning April 1, 2002 and the first day of every succeeding month thereafter. The said note was executed for the purchase of a 2002 Nissan Exalta sedan. It was also stipulated if the respondents should default on the payment of any installment or violate any of the other terms and conditions of the note, then unpaid balance at the time of such default would be immediately due and payable and entitle the Dealer to obtain the possession of the car.\nOn March 5, 2002, the Dealer assigned all its rights and interest in the promissory note to PSB.\nRespondents failed to pay the monthly amortizations beginning February 10, 2004. In a letter dated June 7, 2004, petitioner demanded the payment of the outstanding balance of P251,431. or the surrender of the mortgaged vehicle for purposes of foreclosure to satisfy the obligation, but the respondents refused to do either. Thus, on August 6, 2004, PSB filed a complaint for replevin and damages with an application for a preliminary writ of replevin. The verification and certificate of non-forum shopping was signed by Amelito Chavez (Chavez), one of petitioner's Senior Assistant Managers and who was appointed as legal representative by PSB's Assistant Vice President, Florencio P. Soneja (Soneja), through a notarized Authorization dated July 28, 2004.\nAfter PSB posted a bond, the MeTC issued a Writ of Replevin on August 10, 2004 ordering the sheriff to seize the mortgaged automobile. Upon a perusal of the records, it does not appear that the writ was enforced.\nIn their Answer with Counterclaim, respondents claimed that they were not in default; that they never received demand; and that the verification and certificate of non-forum shopping attached to the complaint failed to show that the person who executed it, Chavez, was authorized to do so by PSB. In their counterclaim, they argued that the complaint is a baseless suit which entitles them to payment of damages and attorney's fees. The said pleading was not signed by any counsel but by herein respondent Amelita Hipolito.\nPretrial was set on December 9, 2004 but was reset to February 10, 2005 as there was no return on the notice sent to defendants. On that day, Amelita appeared without counsel. Thus, the MeTC rescheduled pretrial to March 10, 2005, upon Amelita's manifestation that she would engage the services of counsel. On March 10, 2005, however, neither respondents nor their counsel appeared. Thus, the MeTC declared them in default and set a hearing for petitioner to present evidence ex parte .\nAt 9:55 a.m. of April 5, 2005, five minutes before PSB was to present its evidence, counsel for respondent filed his entry of appearance with an urgent motion to cancel the presentation of evidence on the ground that his services had been engaged only the night before. The following day, MeTC issued an Order denying the motion for: (1) lack of merit in the reason cited by counsel; (2) failing to attach Affidavit of Merit; and (3) violating the three-day notice rule. As such, the MeTC rendered judgment based on the evidence presented ex parte as follows:\nWHEREFORE , judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff [PSB] and against defendants Amelita Hipolito and Alex Hipolito, hereby ordering the said defendants to pay plaintiff, jointly and severally, as follows:\n1. the amount of P251,431. plus late payment penalty charge of 5% per month from date due on February 10, 2004 until fully paid;\n2. the amount equivalent to 20% of the total amount due as liquidated damages;\n3. the amount equivalent to 25% of the total amount due as and for attorney's fees; and\n4. the costs of suit.\nSO ORDERED.\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court\nRespondents appealed to the RTC, which affirmed the MeTC in toto in its Decision dated March 16, 2006. The RTC held that Soneja and Chavez had implied authorization to file suit. Moreover, citing Our ruling in BA Savings Bank v. Sia, the RTC was of the view that the requirement with regard to the certificate of non-forum shopping \"must not be so interpreted with such absolute literalness as to subvert its own ultimate and legitimate objective or the good of all rules of procedures which is to achieve substantial justice as expeditiously as possible.\"\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\nUnsatisfied, respondents filed a petition for review with the CA, which found merit. Because PSB failed to cite any provision of the corporate charter or by-laws or a secretary's certificate from which it could be reasonably inferred that Soneja, in his capacity as assistant vice president, had been granted expressly or impliedly the power or authority to sue, the CA held as follows:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the petition is GRANTED . The challenged decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 112, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE . The complaint of respondent Philippine Savings Bank against the petitioners is ordered DISMISSED .\nSO ORDERED.\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration, arguing that the procedural requirements must yield to substantial justice in light of the fact that MeTC had found respondents to have violated the terms of the promissory note. The CA denied reconsideration because the issues and arguments stated therein had already been judiciously resolved in the Decision.\nIn this petition, PSB now asks that We reverse the CA, praying for a lenient application of the rules on verification and certificate of non-forum shopping in the interest of substantial justice considering that the MeTC had already decided the case on the merits. In addition, attached to the petition is a certified true copy of a Secretary's Certificate that on October 27, 2011, the board of PSB included the assistant vice president in the list of officers authorized to sue in behalf of the bank and to do sign documents as may be necessary.\nCiting a slew of jurisprudence, respondents maintain in their Comment that petitioner must have shown that either Soneja or Chavez were authorized by the corporate by-laws or by specific acts of the board of directors. They assert that Soneja, in his position as assistant vice president, had not been proven to have had implied, incidental, or apparent authority that he could then delegate to Chavez. They argue that petitioner's failure to present evidence of such authorization, even mere photocopies, justified the dismissal of the complaint.\nIssue\nThe sole issue for resolution is whether the defects of the verification and certificate of non-forum shopping justify the dismissal of PSB's complaint.\nRuling of the Court\nThe petition is meritorious.\nRules of procedure may be relaxed to relieve a part of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of non-compliance with the process required. This court has preferred a judicial policy that encourages full adjudication of the merits of a case if strict adherence to technical procedure will defeat the interest of substantial justice. In line with this policy, We affirmed in Shipside Inc., v. Court of Appeals the long-standing doctrine that the verification is a formal - not jurisdictional - requirement of a pleading. We said:\nNon-compliance with which does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective, because verification is simply intended to secure an assurance that the allegations in the pleadings are true and correct and not products of imagination or matters of speculation, and that the pleading is filed in good faith. The court may still act on the pleading if strict compliance with the rules may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served.\nAs for the certificate of non-forum shopping, the general rule is that it must be executed by an officer or member of the board of directors or by one who is duly authorized by a resolution of the board of directors; otherwise, the complaint is not deemed filed, produces no legal effect, and will be dismissed. As an exception, the complaint may not be dismissed if proof of the signatory's preexisting authority is subsequently submitted. In Abaya Investments Corporation v. Merit Philippines, We held that another exception exists when the trial court had already decided on the merits of the case and to apply the general rule would only result in re-litigation of the case and further delay the administration of justice. We hold that this exception applies to this case.\nThe MeTC has already decided on the merits of the case and had disposed of it all the way back in 2005. ℒαwρhi৷ In their appeal to the RTC and then in their petition for review with the CA, the respondents did not bother question the correctness of MeTC's application of the law on the substantive merits. The court ought not insist on technicalities when it has been proven that respondents have defaulted on their obligations under the promissory note. In Mediserv Inc. v. Court of Appeals, We held that the merits of the case should be considered special circumstances or compelling reasons that justify tempering the requirement in regard to the certificate of non-forum shopping. Such requirements must not be interpreted too literally when it would defeat the objective of preventing the undesirable practice of forum-shopping of de-clogging the court dockets. The granting of substantial justice is an even more urgent ideal. In all likelihood, a dismissal of the complaint will only cause re-litigation of the same issues that the MeTC has already passed upon, resulting in further delay in the administration of justice. This will unnecessarily drain the resources of the parties and clog the court dockets, the very scenario that the certificate seeks to avoid.\nAs a final note, We see no error in the MeTC's order allowing PSB to submit evidence ex parte . Although said order is characterized by the parties and the lower courts as a \"default order,\" We clarified in Philippine Steel Coating Corp. v. Quinones the phrase \"as in default\" has been deleted from the Rules, the purpose of which is \"one of semantical propriety or terminological accuracy as there were criticisms on the use of the word default in the former provision since that term is identified with the failure to file a required answer, not appearance in court.\" However, while the order of default no longer obtains, its effects were nevertheless retained. For the MeTC to lift said order, respondents ought to have given an adequate explanation for their absence at pretrial. It is clear that they did not and from that, the court may reasonably infer that perhaps they never had any good defense to begin with. In Momarco Import Company, Inc. v. Villamena We explained why this is so, citing Justice Narvasa's discourse in Gochangco v. CFI Negros Occidental viz .:\nThe underlying philosophy of the doctrine of default is that the defendant's failure to answer the complaint x x x is attributable to one of two causes: either (a) to his realization that he has no defenses to the plaintiffs cause and hence resolves not to oppose the complaint, or, (b) having good defenses to the suit, to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence which prevented him from seasonably filing an answer setting forth those defenses.\nx x x if he did have good defenses, it would be unnatural for him not to set them up properly and timely, and if he did not in fact set them up, it must be presumed that some insuperable cause prevented him from doing so: fraud, accident, mistake, excusable negligence. In this event, the law will grant him relief; and the law is in truth quite liberal in the reliefs made available to him: a motion to set aside the order of default prior to judgment, a motion for new trial to set aside the default judgment; an appeal from the judgment by default even if no motion to set aside the order of default or motion for new trial had been previously presented; a special civil action for certiorari impugning the court's jurisdiction. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nIn light of respondents' consistent failure to diligently attend to the case before PSB presented evidence ex parte , their belated motion to lift the \"default order,\" and their heavy reliance on technicalities as their only defense, the court is of the mind that perhaps they never had a good substantive defense to begin with. They have made no manifestation indicating otherwise. In fact, they were not able to prove that fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence prevented them from lodging any substantive defense. As such, We affirm the MeTC's prerogative to proceed with deciding the case on the merits based on PSB's evidence. There being no reversible error in said decision, the same must be reinstated.\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED . The Decision dated June 27, 2011 and the Resolution dated February 21, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR. SP No. 94151 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE .
