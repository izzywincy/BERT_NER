RACADIO, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nKHO, JR., J.:\nAssailed in this Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court are the Joint Resolution dated April 2, 2018 and the Joint Order dated April 5, 2019 of the Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman) in OMB-L-C-17-0487 and OMB-L-A-17-0532 dismissing the Complaint of petitioner Poro Exim Corporation (petitioner) against private respondent Felix S. Racadio (respondent) on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.\nThe Facts\nThis case stemmed from a Complaint filed by petitioner before the Ombudsman criminally and administratively charging respondent with violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019, abuse of authority, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, grave misconduct, oppression, and violation of Section 5(c) of RA 6713, docketed as OMB-L-C-17-0487 and OMB-L-A-17-0532. Respondent is the Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Poro Point Management Corporation (PPMC), a corporation incorporated under the Corporation Code that is fully owned by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA). PPMC is the operating and implementing arm of the BCDA to manage the Poro Point Freeport Zone (PPFZ), which is a freeport established under RA 7227, as amended by RA 9400.\nIn its Complaint, petitioner, an authorized importer within the PPFZ that was duly accredited by several government agencies, essentially alleged that respondent, in his capacity as PPMC Director, President, and CEO, committed acts that directly prejudiced its importation business. Particularly, petitioner alleged that respondent, under the guise of conducting a thorough and in-depth investigation of petitioner's past dealings, business transactions, and importations within the PPFZ, unduly delayed the approval of its various applications for import permits covering a shipment of more than 200 units of vehicles, equipment, and parts. Moreover, respondent issued petitioner a show-cause order (SCO), claiming that based on his initial investigation report (IIR), the latter committed various violations which, if not controverted, would result in the automatic revocation and cancellation of its Certificate of Registration.\nFurthermore, petitioner claimed that respondent's arbitrary and capricious delay in the approval of such import permits may be evinced from the following: (a) all of petitioner's past applications for import permits were duly approved within two days; (b) the PPMC's Vice President for Regulatory Services already endorsed petitioner's applications to respondent; (c) no notice of any violation of law, rule, or regulation had been given to petitioner with respect to its shipments; (d) no criminal, civil, or administrative case had been filed against petitioner or any of its directors or officers for any such purported violations; (e) respondent was already implementing his new policy, although the same was neither published nor approved by the PPMC Board of Directors; (f) respondent did not cite any law, rule, or regulation as basis for considering petitioner's shipment as \"big volume\" or \"large number\"; (g) respondent refused to issue the import permits despite petitioner's repeated pleas for his immediate action on the applications for such permits, as well as his full awareness of the economic ramifications of such delay; (h) he defeated the PPMC's legal mandate of ensuring the free flow of goods within the PPFZ; and (i) the SCO and IIR, which he signed alone, do not cite any specific provision of law, rule, or regulation that petitioner purportedly violated. Finally, petitioner averred that due to respondents undue delay, it was constrained to withdraw all its applications that it filed before the PPFZ and caused the importation of its shipment into regular customs territory through the Bureau of Customs, Port of San Fernando, and by other locators in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone.\nIn his defense, respondent denied the allegations against him. 1aшphi1 He maintained that since it was his first time to encounter applications for import permits involving a very large volume of vehicles, equipment, and parts, he chose to be prudent by referring such applications to the Board of Directors for approval, but without denying or approving the same. He further contended, inter alia, that applying for an import permit will not automatically result in its grant. Finally, respondent asserted that the Ombudsman has no jurisdiction over him, being an official of the PPMC, which is a Government-Owned and Controlled Corporation (GOCC) without an original charter.\nThe Ombudsman Ruling\nIn a Joint Resolution dated April 2, 2018, the Ombudsman dismissed the Complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.\nPrimarily citing Article XI, Section 13 (2) of the Constitution, in relation to Khan, Jr. v. Office of the Ombudsman (Khan), the Ombudsman held that its jurisdiction over GOC Cs is limited only to those with original charters. Since PPMC is a GOCC without an original charter, the Ombudsman has no jurisdiction over its officers, such as respondent.\nAggrieved, petitioner moved for reconsideration but the same was denied in a Joint Order dated April 5, 2019; hence, this petition.\nThe Issue Before the Court\nThe core issue for the Court's resolution is whether the Ombudsman gravely abused its discretion in dismissing petitioner's Complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.\nThe Court's Ruling\nThe Petition is meritorious.\n\"The term 'grave abuse of discretion' has a specific meaning. An act of a court or tribunal can only be considered as with grave abuse of discretion when such act is done in a 'capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.' The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an 'evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.' Furthermore, the use of a petition for certiorari is restricted only to 'truly extraordinary cases wherein the act of the lower court or quasi-judicial body is wholly void.' From the foregoing definition, it is clear that the special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65 can only strike an act down for having been done with grave abuse of discretion if the petitioner could manifestly show that such act was patent and gross.\"\nIn this case, the Ombudsman, citing Khan, found that Article XI, Section 13 (2) of the Constitution should be interpreted to mean that the \"Ombudsman's jurisdiction over GOC Cs is confined only to those with original charters,\" and as such, it has no jurisdiction over respondent, who is the Director, President, and CEO of PPMC, a GOCC without an original charter.\nThe Court rules that such finding is tainted with grave abuse of discretion, and hence, must be set aside.\nArticle XI, Section 13 of the Constitution provides the powers, functions, and duties of the Ombudsman. The portions pertinent to this case read:\nSection 13. The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions, and duties:\n1. Investigate on its own, or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public official, employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient.\n2. Direct, upon complaint or at its own instance, any public official or employee of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereat as well as of any government-owned or controlled corporation with original charter, to perform and expedite any act or duty required by law, or to stop, prevent, and correct any abuse or impropriety in the performance of duties.\nx x x x\n8. Promulgate its rules of procedure and exercise such other powers or perform such functions or duties as may be provided by law. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)\nIt is an elementary rule in statutory construction that \"[t]he whole and every part of the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce a harmonious whole. A statute must be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible. In short, every meaning to be given to each word or phrase must be ascertained from the context of the body of the statute since a word or phrase in a statute is always used in association with other words or phrases and its meaning may be modified or restricted by the latter.\"\nHere, to limit the Ombudsman's power over GOC Cs only to those with original charters, purportedly pursuant to Article XI, Section 13 (2) of the Constitution, is myopic as it fails to consider the other powers given to the Ombudsman. It is well to emphasize that Article XI, Section 13 of the Constitution explicitly provides that the Ombudsman is tasked to, inter alia, \"investigate x x x any act or omission of any public official, employee, office[,] or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient\" and to \"perform such functions or duties as may be provided by law.\" In this regard, there are various laws which provide the Ombudsman with additional powers, functions, and duties.\nSection 15 (1) of RA 6770, otherwise known as The Ombudsman Act of 1989, explicitly provides that the Ombudsman has the power to \"[i]nvestigate and prosecute . . . any act or omission of any public officer, employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal. It has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan and, in the exercise of his primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigatory agency of Government, the investigation of such cases.\"\nIn relation to this, it is worthy to emphasize that the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan was first delineated in Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1486. Throughout the years, various laws were enacted in relation thereto, such as PD 1606, RA 7975, RA 8249, and RA 10660, most of which expanded the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan to include crimes committed by public officers or employees including those employed in government-owned and controlled corporations without distinction on whether such GOC Cs have original charters or not.\nTo be sure, Section 4 (c) of PD 1606 reads:\nSection 4. Jurisdiction. The Sandiganbayan shall have jurisdiction over:\nx x x x\n(c) Other crimes or offenses committed by public officers or employees, including those employed in government-owned or controlled corporations, in relation to their office.\nLater on, Section 2 of RA 7975 essentially retained the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction over GOC Cs in the following manner:\nSection 2. Section 4 of the same Decree is hereby further amended to read as follows:\nSec. 4. Jurisdiction. The Sandiganbayan shall exercise original jurisdiction in all cases involving:\na. Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII of the Revised Penal Code, where one or more of the principal accused are officials occupying the following positions in the government, whether in permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense:\n(1) Officials of the executive branch occupying the positions of regional director and higher, otherwise classified as grade 27 and higher, of the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 (Republic Act No. 6758), specifically including:\nx x x x\n(g) Presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations, state universities or educational institutions or foundations;\nb. Other offenses or felonies committed by the public officials and employees mentioned in subsection (a) of this section in relation to their office.\nThereafter, Section 4 of RA 8249 retained in essence the foregoing provision in RA 7975 insofar as GOC Cs are concerned, to wit:\nSection 4. Section 4 of the same decree is hereby further amended to read as follows:\na. Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII, Book II, of the Revised Penal Code, where one or more of the accused are officials occupying the following positions in the government whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense:\nx x x x\n(g) Presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations, state universities or educational institutions or foundations;\nb. Other offenses or felonies whether simple or complexed with other crimes committed by the public officials and employees mentioned in subsection a of this section in relation to their office.\nFinally, Section 2 RA 10660 also retained the same provision as follows:\nSection 2. Section 4 of the same decree, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:\nSEC. 4. Jurisdiction.  The Sandiganbayan shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases involving:\na. Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII, Book II of the Revised Penal Code, where one or more of the accused are officials occupying the following positions in the government, whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense:\n(1) Officials of the executive branch occupying the positions of regional director and higher, otherwise classified as Grade '27' and higher, of the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 (Republic Act No. 6758), specifically including:\nx x x x\n(g) Presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations, state universities or educational institutions or foundations.\nb. 1aшphi1 Other offenses or felonies whether simple or complexed with other crimes committed by the public officials and employees mentioned in subsection a. of this section in relation to their office.\nFurthermore, case law promulgated during the enactment of the foregoing amendatory laws has recognized the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction over \"presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations,\" without any distinction on whether such GOC Cs have original charters or not.\nIn People v. Sandiganbayan, a case involving a complaint filed during the effectivity of RA 8249 against the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Philippine Postal Savings Bank (PPSB), a subsidiary of the Philippine Postal Corporation which is a government-owned corporation not created by special law, the Court, through Justice (and eventual Chief Justice) Renato C. Corona, explicitly ruled that the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over presidents, directors, trustees, or managers of GOC Cs, regardless of whether or not they have original charters, viz. :\nDoes the Sandiganbayan have jurisdiction over presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations organized and incorporated under the Corporation Code for purposes of the provisions of RA 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act?\nx x x x\nIt is not disputed that the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters whenever charges of graft and corruption are involved. 1aшphi1 However, a question arises whether the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over the same officers in government-owned or controlled corporations organized and incorporated under the Corporation Code in view of the delimitation provided for in Article IX-B Section 2(1) of the 1987 Constitution which states that:\nSEC. 2. (1) The Civil Service embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters.\nIt should be pointed out however, that the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan is separate and distinct from the Civil Service Commission. The same is governed by Article XI, Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution which provides that \"the present anti-graft court known as the Sandiganbayan shall continue to function and exercise its jurisdiction as now or hereafter may be provided by law.\" This provision, in effect, retained the jurisdiction of the anti-graft court as defined under Article XIII, Section 5 of the 1973 Constitution which mandated its creation, thus:\nSec. 5. The Batasang Pambansa shall create a special court, to be known as Sandiganbayan, which shall have jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases involving graft and corrupt practices and such other offense committed by public officers and employees, including those in government­ owned or controlled corporations, in relation to their office as may be determined by law. (Italics ours)\nOn March 30, 1995, Congress, pursuant to its authority vested under the 1987 Constitution, enacted RA 7975 maintaining the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan over presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations without any distinction whatsoever. Thereafter, on February 5, 1997, Congress enacted RA 8249 which preserved the subject provision:\nSection 4. Jurisdiction. The Sandiganbayan shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases involving:\na. Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and Chapter II, Section, Title VII, Book II of the Revised Penal Code, where one or more of the accused are officials occupying the following positions in the government, whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense,\n(1) Officials of the executive branch occupying the positions of regional director, and higher, otherwise classified as grade \"27\" and higher, of the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 (Republic Act No. 6758) specifically including:\nx x x x\n(g) Presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations, state universities or educational institutions or foundations. (Italics ours)\nThe legislature, in mandating the inclusion of presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations\" within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, has consistently refrained from making any distinction with respect to the manner of their creation.\nThe deliberate omission, in our view, clearly reveals the intention of the legislature to include the presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of both types of corporations within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan whenever they are involved in graft and corruption. Had it been otherwise, it could have simply made the necessary distinction. But it did not.\nIt is a basic principle of statutory construction that when the law does not distinguish, we should not distinguish. Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguere debemos. Corollarily, Article XI Section 12 of the 1987 Constitution, on the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman (the government's prosecutory arm against persons charged with graft and corruption), includes officers and employees of government-owned or controlled corporations, likewise without any distinction. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)\nIn Carandang v. Desierto, a case also involving a complaint filed during the effectivity of RA 8249, the Court, through Justice (and eventual Chief Justice) Lucas P. Bersamin, similarly ruled:\nIt is not disputed that the Ombudsman has jurisdiction over administrative cases involving grave misconduct committed by the officials and employees of government-owned or -controlled corporations; and that the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction to try and decide criminal actions involving violations of R.A. 3019 committed by public officials and employees, including presidents, directors and managers of government­ owned or -controlled corporations. The respective jurisdictions of the respondents are expressly defined and delineated by the law.\nIn Garcia v. Sandiganbayan, the Court, through Justice Andres B. Reyes, Jr., in ruling that the Sandiganbayan has the inherent power to issue hold departure orders, also recognized, albeit in passing, the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases involving graft and corrupt practices and such other offenses committed by public officers and employees, including those in GOC Cs:\nAs to the question on the determination of the necessity of the issuance of HD Os, it is largely dependent on the good judgment of the Sandiganbayan. It is worth reiterating that it is a special court tasked with a particular undertaking of hearing and deciding \"criminal and civil cases involving graft and corrupt practices and such other offenses committed by public officers and employees, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations, in relation to their office. It is of the same level as the Court of Appeals and possesses all the inherent powers of a court of justice. Considering the complexity of its tasks which was made even more complicated by the fact that it is dealing with high-ranking public officials and employees, it is given the wide latitude of resorting to the exercise of its express and implied powers for the proper determination of the fitting recompense for the injury done to the government.\nFinally, in Maligalig v. Sandiganbayan, which involves a complaint filed when RA 10660 was already the prevailing law insofar as the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction is concerned, the Court, through Chief Justice Diosdado M. Peralta, again recognized the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction over officials of GOC Cs, to wit:\nIn law, nothing is as elementary as the concept of jurisdiction, for the same is the foundation upon which the courts exercise their power of adjudication, and without which, no rights or obligation could emanate from any decision or resolution. Jurisdiction is defined as the power and authority of a court to hear, try and decide a case. The jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan is provided in P.D. No. 1606, as amended by R.A. No. 10660, which, insofar as relevant in this case, reads as follows:\nx x x x\nIn this case, the two (2) Informations filed against the petitioner before the Sandiganbayan showed that he was charged with Violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019, and Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Document. The Information for violation of the anti­ graft law asserts that petitioner, \"in the discharge of his administrative and\/or official functions and taking advantage of his official position, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and criminally, with evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence\" performed the acts constitutive of the offense charged. On the other hand, the charge for the complex crime of Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Document was allegedly committed by the petitioner \"while in the performance of or in relation to his office and taking advantage of his official position.\" Both Informations also alleged that petitioner is a public officer \"being then the President and a member of the Board of Directors of the Bataan Shipyard and Engineering Co., Inc. (BASECO), a government-owned or -controlled corporation.\" Thus, on the basis of the allegations in the accusatory Informations alone, there is sufficient basis for the Sandiganbayan to take cognizance of the two (2) cases against the petitioner. The jurisdiction of a court over a criminal case is determined by the allegations in the complaint or information. And once it is shown, the court may validly take cognizance of the case.\nPetitioner's defense that he was not a public officer at the time of the alleged commission of the offense does not hold water. It is well-settled that, \"jurisdiction is not affected by the pleas or the theories set up by defendant or respondent in an answer, a motion to dismiss, or a motion to quash. Otherwise, jurisdiction would become dependent almost entirely upon the whims of defendant or respondent.\" Besides, his admission in his Counter-Affidavit filed before the Office of the Ombudsman that he was appointed as member of the Board of Directors, and eventually as President of BASECO by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, militates against his claim that he was not a public officer. A public officer is defined in the Revised Penal Code as \"any person who, by direct provision of the law, popular election, or appointment by competent authority, shall take part in the performance of public functions in the Government of the Philippine Islands, or shall perform in said Government, or in any of its branches, public duties as an employee, agent or subordinate official, of any rank or class.\" The concept of a public officer was expounded further in the Serana case, where it was held that, \"An investment in an individual of some portion of the sovereign functions of the government, to be exercised by him for the benefit of the public makes one a public officer.\" As President of a sequestered company like BASECO, petitioner is expected to perform functions that would benefit the public in general.\nThus, the Sandiganbayan did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's Motion to Quash and Motion for Reconsideration. It definitely has jurisdiction over the case and over the person of the petitioner since offenses for violation of R.A. No. 3019 and the complex crime of Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Document and petitioner's position, as alleged in the two (2) Informations, are clearly among those offenses and felonies and public officers enumerated in P.D. No. 1606, as amended by R.A. No. 10660.\nAs may be gleaned from the foregoing, the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction over \"[p]residents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations,\" without any distinction on whether such GOC Cs have original charters or not, is well-settled both in law and jurisprudence.\nSince the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over presidents, directors, trustees, or managers of GOC Cs, regardless of whether they were incorporated through original charters, then the Ombudsman, in accordance with Article XI, Section 13 (8) of the Constitution and Section 15 (1) of RA 6770, also has jurisdiction over them.\nAt this juncture, suffice it to say that the case relied upon by the Ombudsman  Khan, which held that the jurisdiction over GOC Cs is confined only to those with original charters  have no application in this case. This is considering that the complaint subject of Khan was filed in February 1989, or before the enactment of: (a) RA 6770 which provided through statute the additional powers of the Ombudsman; and (b) RA 7975, RA 8249, and RA 10660, all of which provided for the expanded jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, as previously discussed. On the other hand, the Complaint filed by herein petitioner was filed on August 10, 2017, or during the effectivity of RA 6770 and RA 10660.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Court rules that the Ombudsman has jurisdiction over the Complaint filed against respondent by herein petitioner; hence, it gravely abused its discretion in ruling that it had none. In this regard, since the Ombudsman merely dismissed such Complaint on this ground and did not traverse the merits thereof, it is only prudent that the Court reinstates OMB-L-C-17-0487 and OMB-L-A-17-0532, and thereafter, remand the same to the Ombudsman for a resolution on the merits.\nACCORDINGLY, the Petition is GRANTED . The Ombudsman's Joint Resolution dated October 26, 2015 and the Joint Order dated June 20, 2016 in OMB-L-C-17-0487 and OMB-L-A-17-0532 are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE .

FLORES, PETITIONERS, VS. DOMINADOR M. LIBUNAO, EVAGRIO S. LIBUNAO, NOE S. LIBUNAO, MAYO S. LIBUNAO, AND DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM ADJUDICATION BOARD (DARAB) , RESPONDENTS.\nINTING, J.:\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by Adriano S. Lorenzo, Sr., Jose D. Flores III, and Carlos S. Flores (petitioners) assailing the Decision dated June 30, 2021, and the Resolution dated May 24,2022, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 164049. The CA dismissed the petition for review and affirmed the Decision dated June 22, 2018 of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) in DARAB Case No. 17247 (Reg. Case No. III-T-2379-03) which affirmed the Decision dated January 27, 2009 of the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) of Diwa ng Tarlak, Tarlac City .\nThe Antecedents\nThe case stemmed from an Amended Complaint for Cancellation of Titles and Emancipation Patents and Maintenance of Possession filed on July 26, 2005, by petitioners against Dominador M. Libunao, Evagrio S. Libunao, NoeS. Libunao, and Mayo S. Libunao (respondents), before the PARAD. The complaint involved a nine-hectare portion of a tract of agricultural riceland known as the Patricio Pineda Estate located in Barangay San Roque, La Paz, Tarlac (subject land).\nPetitioners alleged the following:\nPetitioners have been in possession of the subject land through their predecessors-in-interest since 1978, and by themselves beginning 1994. The Barangay Agrarian Reform Committee Chairperson and other farmer-­residents of La Paz, Tarlac, certified petitioners' possession. They had previously filed their respective applications with the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office (MARO) of La Paz, Tarlac, for them to be declared as qualified farmer-beneficiaries of the portions they were cultivating. However, their applications were reported to be missing. Sometime in 2003, they were informed at the conference set by the MARO that emancipation patents and titles over the landholdings they were cultivating were already issued to respondents. They believed that respondents must have employed fraudulent means to secure the emancipation patents and titles in their favor because they never possessed or cultivated the land so as to become entitled to it.\nFor their part, respondents denied having employed fraud or machinations in their applications for emancipation patents. Further, they alleged that the MARO of La Paz, Tarlac, and the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) have duly administratively identified them as the qualified farmer-beneficiaries of the portions of the landholdings that they have been cultivating, resulting in the issuance of the corresponding emancipation patents and transfer certificates of title in their favor. They furthermore averred that they have been in actual and physical possession of their respective landholdings for a long period of time, as certified by the barangay chairperson of San Roque, La Paz, Tarlac. As such, they moved that the complaint be dismissed.\nRuling of the PARAD\nIn its Decision dated January 27, 2009, Provincial Adjudicator Vicente Aselo S. Sicat of the PARAD dismissed the complaint and affirmed the validity of respondents' emancipation patents and titles. He ruled that the DAR's administrative identification of respondents as the legitimate qualified farmer-beneficiaries of the subject land enjoys the presumption of regularity and legality in the absence of any convincing and credible evidence to the contrary. He decreed that, except for petitioners' bare allegations, they failed to adduce evidence that respondents were not in actual possession of the subject land.\nRuling of the DARAB\nInitially, in its Decision dated June 22, 2018, the DARAB denied petitioners' appeal and accordingly affirmed the PARAD's findings. It ruled that without any concrete proof of the alleged fraud in the processing and issuance of the emancipation patents and titles to respondents, they shall remain valid.\nSubsequently, the DARAB issued its Resolution dated October 28, 2019 denying petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration for want of jurisdiction. According to the DARAB, the exclusive original jurisdiction to resolve cases involving the cancellation of titles issued under any agrarian reform program has already been transferred to the DAR Secretary or his authorized representative.\nRuling of the CA\nIn its Decision dated June 30, 2021, the CA denied the petition for review. It ruled that the DARAB correctly divested itself of jurisdiction to rule upon the case in view of the passage of Republic Act No. (RA) 9700, which transferred the exclusive and original jurisdiction of all cases involving cancellation of emancipation patents, certificate of land ownership award and titles to the DAR Secretary. It also noted that the DARAB in fact had no jurisdiction to take on petitioners' appeal because, at the time petitioners filed their appeal on November 20, 2009, RA 9700 was already in force and in effect.\nHence, petitioners filed the present petition raising the following issues:\nIssues\nWHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, PARAD[,] AND DARAB ERRED IN NOT APPRECIATING THE EVIDENCE OF THE PETITIONERS;\nx x x WHO BETWEEN THE PETITIONERS AND RESPONDENTS ARE QUALIFIED TO BECOME BENEFICIARIES OF THE LAND IN QUESTION;\nWHETHER OR NOT THE x x x EMANCIPATION PATENT NO. 00751354, EMANCIPATION PATENT NO. 00751355, EMANCIPATION PATENT NO. 00751356, EMANCIPATION PATENT NO. 00751357, IN THE NAME OF EVAGRIO S. LIBUNAO, DOMINADOR LIBUNAO, NOE S. LIBUNAO[,] AND MAYO LIBUNAO COULD BE CANCELLED.\nEssentially, petitioners aver that the PARAD erred in affirming the emancipation patents and titles issued to respondents notwithstanding that petitioners, and not respondents, have been in actual and continuous possession of the subject land.\nOur Ruling\nThe petition is unmeritorious.\nAt the outset, while petitioners do not raise this as an issue, the Court deems it necessary to emphasize that the CA correctly affirmed the DARAB's Resolution divesting itself of jurisdiction in view of the enactment of RA 9700. Specifically, Section 9 of RA 9700 amending Section 24 of RA 6657 provides:\nSEC. 24. Award to Beneficiaries.  x x x x\nx x x x\nAll cases involving the cancellation of registered emancipation patents, certificates of land ownership award, and other titles issued under any agrarian reform program are within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Secretary of the DAR.\nAs the CA aptly ruled:\n[I]t may be well to state that at the time the instant complaint for cancellation was filed in July 2005, the jurisdictional setup was that the DARAB will take cognizance of cases that involve the issuance, correction and cancellation of registered Emancipation Patents (E Ps), Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLO As), and other agrarian titles. If the said EP[s], CLO As and titles were still unregistered, jurisdiction lies with the DAR Secretary. However, when Congress passed Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9700 on August 7, 2009 amending R.A. No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, all cases involving the cancellation of E Ps, CLO As and titles issued in relation thereto, whether registered with the Land Registration Authority (LRA) or not, are now within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Refom1 (DAR) Secretary. He or she takes jurisdiction over cases involving the cancellation of titles issued under any agrarian reform program of the government. 1âшphi1\nx x x x\nx x x It is the Agrarian Reform Secretary who has the authority and power to probe into the validity of the issuance of the E Ps and titles in favor of respondents and determine their qualification as farmers-­beneficiaries. It may also be well to note that at the time the appeal was filed by petitioners with the DARAB on November 20, 2009, R.A. No. 9700 was already in force and in effect. £A⩊phi£ Hence, the DARAB had no more jurisdiction to take cognizance of the appeal.\nAccordingly, the CA committed no reversible error when it denied the petition for review and ruled that the DARAB lacks jurisdiction to resolve petitioners' appeal.\nIn any case, the present case must still be denied.\nA petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is confined only to reviewing errors of law, not of fact. In the case, petitioners are clearly begging the Court to reevaluate their pieces of evidence to determine who between them and respondents actually possessed the subject land as to be entitled to the issuance of the emancipation patents, which is outside the scope and function of this Court. While the Court has allowed certain exceptions for the review of the factual findings of the lower tribunals, none of the exceptions are present in this case.\nNevertheless, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction holds that \"if a case is such that its determination requires the expertise, specialized training and knowledge of the proper administrative bodies, relief must first be obtained in an administrative proceeding before a remedy is supplied by the courts even if the matter may well be within their proper jurisdiction.\" Here, upon the enactment of RA 9700, petitioners should have directed their appeal or filed a new case for cancellation of respondents' patents and titles before the DAR Secretary as the administrative entity determined by law to have the expertise and knowledge in resolving the issue. Hence, petitioners' premature invocation of the CA and the Court's judicial powers is fatal to their cause of action warranting the outright dismissal of the present petition.\nAll told, the present petition is patently without merit as to warrant the Court's exercise of discretionary appellate jurisdiction.\nWHEREFORE , the petition for review on certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit. The Decision dated June 30, 2021 and the Resolution dated May 24, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 164049 are AFFIRMED .\nSO ORDERED.\nCaguioa (Chairperson), Gaerlan, Dimaampao, and Singh, JJ., concur.\n","label":[[24,39,"CASE_NUM"],[41,58,"PROM_DATE"],[61,84,"PERSON"],[86,104,"PERSON"],[133,152,"PERSON"],[158,174,"PERSON"],[193,213,"PERSON"],[215,233,"PERSON"],[235,249,"PERSON"],[251,266,"PERSON"],[272,320,"INS"],[322,327,"INS"],[421,444,"PERSON"],[446,464,"PERSON"],[470,486,"PERSON"],[590,606,"INS"],[608,610,"INS"],[615,636,"CASE_NUM"],[642,644,"INS"],[732,780,"INS"],[782,787,"INS"],[792,797,"INS"],[798,812,"CASE_NUM"],[819,841,"CASE_NUM"],[901,953,"INS"],[955,960,"INS"],[1183,1203,"PERSON"],[1205,1223,"PERSON"],[1225,1238,"PERSON"],[1244,1259,"PERSON"],[1286,1291,"INS"],[1388,1410,"INS"],[1653,1687,"INS"],[1847,1879,"INS"],[1881,1885,"INS"],[2126,2130,"INS"],[2612,2616,"INS"],[2644,2673,"INS"],[2675,2678,"INS"],[3226,3231,"INS"],[3295,3317,"PERSON"],[3325,3330,"INS"],[3448,3451,"INS"],[3862,3867,"INS"],[3920,3925,"INS"],[3982,3987,"INS"],[4191,4196,"INS"],[4225,4241,"PROM_DATE"],[4333,4338,"INS"],[4507,4510,"INS"],[4569,4571,"INS"],[4613,4615,"INS"],[4666,4671,"INS"],[4762,4788,"RA"],[4963,4966,"INS"],[5001,5006,"INS"],[5140,5147,"RA"],[5296,5312,"INS"],[5314,5319,"INS"],[5814,5819,"INS"],[6176,6178,"INS"],[6202,6207,"INS"],[6282,6289,"RA"],[6318,6325,"RA"],[6349,6356,"RA"],[6662,6665,"INS"],[6674,6676,"INS"],[6834,6839,"INS"],[6939,6959,"STA"],[6961,6965,"STA"],[6968,7004,"STA"],[7006,7012,"STA"],[7131,7144,"INS"],[7176,7204,"RA"],[7232,7245,"RA"],[7253,7286,"STA"],[7328,7332,"STA"],[7334,7340,"STA"],[7408,7435,"INS"],[7437,7440,"INS"],[7508,7536,"INS"],[7539,7542,"INS"],[7724,7739,"INS"],[7832,7836,"STA"],[8023,8028,"INS"],[8051,8064,"RA"],[8120,8125,"INS"],[8202,8204,"INS"],[8293,8298,"INS"],[8444,8451,"STA"],[8459,8473,"STA"],[9383,9390,"RA"],[9521,9534,"INS"],[9690,9692,"INS"],[10108,10124,"INS"],[10128,10149,"CASE_NUM"],[10177,10184,"PERSON"],[10200,10207,"PERSON"],[10209,10218,"PERSON"],[10224,10229,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

BIBAT-PALAMOS, IN HER CAPACITY AS ACTING PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 108, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF PASAY CITY, AND THE NATIONAL GRID CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nKHO, JR., J.:\nBefore the Court is a special civil action for certiorari 1 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court filed by petitioner Social Security System (SSS) assailing the Orders dated March 2, 2017 2 and April 24, 2017 3 issued by public respondent Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 108 (RTC) in Civil Case No. R-PSY-20219-CV. The assailed orders granted private respondent National Grid Corporation of the Philippines's (NGCP) motion for issuance of writ of possession in its complaint for expropriation against SSS.\nThe Facts\nNGCP is a private corporation that, pursuant to Republic Act No. (RA) 9511, 4 was granted a franchise to \"operate, manage and maintain, and . . . engage in the business of conveying or transmitting electricity . . . and to construct, install, finance, manage, improve, expand, operate, maintain, rehabilitate, repair, and refurbish the present nationwide transmission system of the Republic of the Philippines.\" 5\nOn July 16, 2015, NGCP filed a Complaint 6 for expropriation of a 46,218 sq. m. parcel of land registered in the name of the Republic of the Philippines and occupied by SSS. NGCP alleged that it needed the property for its Pasay 230kV Substation Project aimed at meeting the increasing demand for electricity in the Greater Manila Area. 7 The Complaint was subsequently amended 8 to remove the other defendants and retain SSS.\nOn November 2, 2016, NGCP filed an Urgent Motion 9 to deposit the provisional amount of PHP 1,460,928,000., representing the value of the property based on the zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). In the same motion, NGCP prayed that after the deposit is made, an Order be issued granting it the right to take possession of the property. 10 SSS filed its Opposition 11 to the Motion, to which NGCP replied. 12\nIn an Order 13 dated December 20, 2016, the RTC directed NGCP to deposit the amount of PHP 1,460,928,000. with the Office of the Clerk of Court. NGCP then filed its Compliance with the RTC's Order, coupled with an Urgent Ex-Parte Motion for the Issuance of a Writ of Possession. 14 SSS also opposed 15 said Motion, to which NGCP replied. 16\nThe RTC Ruling\nIn its Order 17 dated March 2, 2017, the RTC granted NGCP's Motion and issued a writ of possession in its favor. Citing Section 6 of RA 10752, 18 it held that upon payment by the agency seeking expropriation of the value of the property based on the BIR zonal valuation, the court shall immediately issue an order for the implementing agency to take possession of the property. SSS sought for reconsideration, 19 which the RTC denied through an Order 20 dated April 24, 2017.\nSSS then filed the instant special civil action for certiorari 21 directly with the Court, arguing that: (a) the principle of hierarchy of courts should be relaxed in this case since it involves an issue of transcendental importance, namely, whether a private corporation such as NGCP can initiate expropriation proceedings on its own without proper deputation from the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) or the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC); (b) the RTC gravely abused its discretion in issuing the assailed orders because Section 6 of RA 10752 applies only to acquisition of real properties needed as right-of-way, site, or location for national government projects undertaken by agencies of the government. As a private corporation, NGCP is not included in this provision of law; (c) Section 6 of RA 10752 also requires the OSG or the OGCC or its deputized counsel to initiate the expropriation proceedings; (d) NGCP's delegated right of eminent domain under RA 10752 does not allow it to expropriate property that is already devoted to public use, as in this case, where the property is occupied by another government agency; (e) the RTC gravely abused its discretion when it issued the writ of possession without first resolving the issue of NGCP's authority to expropriate a government property; and (f) it appears that there is no genuine necessity to expropriate since NGCP did not offer to buy the property. SSS also prayed for the issuance of a status quo ante order. 22\nNGCP filed its Comment 23 on July 20, 2017, asserting that: (1) the Petition violates the principle of hierarchy of courts for directly resorting to this Court; (2) the RTC committed no grave abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Orders; and (3) SSS is not entitled to a status quo ante order. ℒαwρhi৷\nIn a Resolution 24 dated June 21, 2017, the Court issued a status quo ante order enjoining the implementation of the assailed Orders.\nSSS filed its Reply 25 to NGCP's comment on November 20, 2017, after which, in its Resolution 26 dated June 27, 2018, the Court required the parties to file their respective memoranda. SSS filed its Memorandum 27 on November 12, 2018, while NGCP filed its Memorandum 28 on November 15, 2018.\nOn June 30, 2020, NGCP filed a Motion to Remand 29 the case records to the RTC. NGCP manifested that due to the uncertainty as to when it can start its project in the property, it has decided to look for alternative sites. Thus, it filed an Omnibus Motion to Withdraw the complaint for expropriation and provisional deposit. 30 However, its Motion to Withdraw cannot be acted on without the case records. Accordingly, the Court granted the Motion to Remand and transmitted the case records to the court of origin. 31\nOn March 7, 2022, SSS filed a Motion to Withdraw 32 the instant Petition. It manifested that in an Order 33 dated July 21, 2021, the RTC, upon receipt of the case records from this Court, granted NGCP's Motion to Withdraw its expropriation complaint. Accordingly, the present Petition has been rendered moot.\nThe Issue Before the Court\nThe issue for the Court's resolution is whether the Petition may be dismissed on the ground of mootness.\nThe Court's Ruling\nThe Petition is dismissed.\nAn order issuing a writ of possession in an expropriation case is an interlocutory order. 34 As an interlocutory order, it is dependent on and incidental to the main petition for expropriation. Here, it is borne by the records and pointed out by SSS that the RTC granted NGCP's Motion to Withdraw the complaint and released the provisional deposits made by NGCP. (awÞhi(\nIndeed, case law provides that where the main action is already dismissed or disposed of, resolving a petition for certiorari assailing interlocutory orders issued in that case would be manifestly pointless. 35 In Philippine Veterans Bank v. Court of Appeals, 36 the Court elucidated on this matter as follows:\nA case or issue is considered moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be of no practical value or use. In such instance, there is no actual substantial relief which a petitioner would be entitled to, and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition. Courts generally decline jurisdiction over such case or dismiss it on the ground of mootness. This is because the judgment will not serve any useful purpose or have any practical legal effect because, in the nature of things, it cannot be enforced. 37\nA case becomes moot when no useful purpose can be served in passing upon the merits. The Court will generally refuse to resolve issues that are moot and academic, except in a few instances, 38 which however, do not obtain here.\nFurther, the Court finds that none of the exceptions exist that would enable it to resolve the issues here despite their mootness.

PONDOC, THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR COA REGIONAL OFFICE CARAGA THE CLUSTER DIRECTOR, CLUSTER 2  LEGISLATIVE AND OVERSIGHT, NATIONAL GOVERNMENT SECTOR, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nLOPEZ, M., J.:\nMay the Commission on Audit (COA) Proper review and reverse its ruling of exemption motu proprio ? This is the primordial issue raised in this Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Rules of Court, assailing the December 22, 2021 Resolution of the COA Proper in Decision No. 2021-491.\nFacts\nPursuant to Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 01, which laid down the revised policies on Program on Awards and Incentives for Service Excellence, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) issued Office Circular (OC) No. 03-2005 providing the guidelines for the establishment and implementation of its own award system, known as the NEDA Awards and Incentives System (NAIS). Among the awards available under the NAIS is the Cost Economy Measure Award (CEMA)a monetary incentive \"[g]ranted to an employee or team whose contributions such as ideas, suggestions, inventions, discoveries or performance of functions result in savings in terms of manhours and cost or otherwise benefit the agency and government as a whole.\"\nNEDA Regional Office XIU-Caraga Region (NEDA Caraga) then granted across-the-board CEMA to its employees in 2010, 2011, and 2012, charged against the agency's year-end savings.\nHowever, upon post-audit, the Audit Team Leader (ATL) and Supervising Auditor (SA) found that the CEMA was irregular and unauthorized because it was: (1) not in accord with the Total Compensation Framework established under the Senate and House of Representatives Joint Resolution (JR) No. 04; (2) not supported by specific appropriations; and (3) not supported by clear and sufficient indicators, baselines, metrics, or standards that would justify entitlement to the award. Thus, the ATL and SA issued an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM), recommending the refund of the CEMA and imposition of sanctions against the erring officials and employees. NEDA Caraga officials were also reminded to ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations in its future grant of monetary incentives.\nThen NEDA Caraga Regional Director, Carmencita S. Cochingco (Cochingco) responded in a Letter that argued for the validity of the CEMA and invoked good faith in its grant and receipt.\nUnconvinced, the ATL and SA issued an ND, disallowing the CEMA disbursed from 2010 to 2012, amounting to an aggregate of PHP 882,759., for the same reasons stated in the AOM. Conchingco, together with the other NEDA Caraga officers, namely: Venus S. Derequito (Derequito); Sherwin T. Sells (Sells); Elsie O. Casurra (Casurra); and Jayson G. Dy (Dy), were held liable under the ND for approving and\/or certifying the grant of CEMA. NEDA Caraga employees, which include Michelle P. Dela Calzada, et al. (petitioners), were also made liable under the ND as recipients. The ND was sent to NEDA Caraga through Cochingco and its accountant, Dy.\nInsisting on the validity of the CEMA grant, then NEDA Caraga Officer-in-Charge Mylah Faye Aurora B. Cariño questioned the ND before the COA National Government Sector (NGS)  Cluster 2. In its Decision No. 2015-03, the NGS affirmed the validity of the ND, as well as the liability of the approving and\/or certifying officers. But as mere passive recipients of the disallowed amount, petitioners Michael P. Dela Calzada et al. (Dela Calzada et al.) were excused from the obligation to refund.\nAfter automatic review, the COA Proper issued Decision No. 2018-306. It approved the NGS ruling in its entirety-confirmed the validity of the ND and liability of the approving and\/or certifying officers, and the absolution of the passive recipients on the ground of good faith, citing Silang v. Commission on Audit.\nCochingco and the other officer liable under the ND, together with the incumbent Regional Director of NEDA Caraga, Bonifacio G. Uy (Uy), filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration, asserting the validity of the CEMA grant and arguing for their exemption from liability on the ground of good faith. In the alternative, the officers prayed that they be made to refund only the amount that each of them received. Dela Calzada, et al., on the other hand, did not file a motion for reconsideration since they were already absolved from liability.\nIn the assailed Decision No. 2021-491, the COA Proper sustained the validity of the ND and the solidary liability of the officers to refund the total amount of disallowance. The COA proper went further to revisit its ruling on petitioners' liability despite non-participation of the petitioners in the motion:\nAs to the payees, this Commission revisits its ruling exempting them from liability in view of the ruling of the SC in the recent case of Chozas [v. Commission on Audit], where the SC held that:\nThe natural consequence of a finding that the allowances and benefits were illegally disbursed, is the consequent obligation on the part of all the recipients to restore said amounts to the government coffers. Such directive is in accord with Article 22 of the Civil Code. which states that, \"[e]very person who through an act of performance by another, or any other means, acquires or comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just or legal ground, shall return the same to him.\" This principle of unjust enrichment applies when, \"(i) a person is unjustly benefited: and (ii) such benefit is derived at the expense of or with damages to another.\"\nThis strict stance is evidence from the Court's recent pronouncements in Rotoras, James Arthur T Dubongco, Provincial Agrarian Reform Program Officer II of Department of Agrarian Reform Provincial Office-Cavite in Representation of Darpo-Cavite and All Its Officials and Employees [v.] Commission on Audit, and Department of Public Works and Highways [v.] COA, where the Court ordered the full restitution of all benefits unlawfully received by government employees. Furthermore, the Court in Rotoras stressed that the defense of good faith shall no longer work to exempt them [sic] the payees from such obligation, [...]:\n. . . .\nWHEREFORE, .... the Motion for Partial Reconsideration of [Cochingco], former Regional Director (RD), et al., all of the [NEDA RO XIII], represented by the incumbent RD, [Uy], is hereby DENIED . Accordingly, [COA] Decision No. 2018-306 dated March 15, 2018, which approved COA [NGS]  Cluster 2 Decision No. 2015-03 dated January 12, 2015, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that the employees who received the benefits remain liable to refund the amount they received. (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)\nAggrieved, Dela Calzada et al. challenge the Decision. They argue that the COA Proper committed grave abuse of discretion when it reversed its previous ruling, which had already attained finality, excluding them from liability. They emphasized that they were not parties to the officers' Motion for Partial Reconsideration, and their right to due process was violated. In any case, petitioners invoke good faith and claim that the CEMA that they received has valid and sufficient factual and legal bases.\nThe COA Proper, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), counters that the Motion for Partial Reconsideration prevented Decision No. 2018-306 from attaining finality since the issue on the validity of the ND is not severable from the issue on the liabilities. Assuming that Decision No. 2018-306 had already attained finality, the OSG posits that the exceptions on immutability of judgments apply, i.e., existence of special or compelling circumstances. 1aшphi1 Specifically, the OSG argues that the application of the supervening jurisprudence and the correction of the inequitable effect of making the officers solely liable for the disallowed amount are sufficient justifications for the COA Proper to rectify its previous ruling on petitioners' liability.\nIssue\nWhether the COA Proper committed grave abuse of discretion in reinstating the liability of Dela Calzada et al. in the ND based on the Motion for Partial Reconsideration filed by the approving and\/or certifying officers.\nRuling\nWe answer in the affirmative.\nGenerally, this Court sustains the rulings of the COA in deference to its constitutional mandate with regard to expenditures of government funds, as well as its presumed expertise in the laws entrusted to them to enforce. However, through the extraordinary writ of certiorari, the Court would annul decisions and resolutions of the COA when it has clearly acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\" We have consistently explained:\nThe special civil action for certiorari is intended for correction of errors of jurisdiction ... or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Its principal office is ... to keep the inferior court within the parameters of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\n. . . .\nExcess of jurisdiction as distinguished from absence of jurisdiction means that an act, though within the general power of a tribunal, board or officer, is not authorized and invalid with respect to the particular proceeding, because the conditions which alone authorize the exercise of general power in respect of it are wanting. Without jurisdiction means lack or want of legal power, right or authority to hear and determine a cause or causes, considered either in general or with reference to a particular matter. It means lack of power to exercise authority. Grave abuse of discretion implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack [or excess] of jurisdiction or, in other words, where the power is exercised in an arbitrary manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility, and it must be so patent or gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law. (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)\nIn this case, we find that the COA Proper committed grave abuse of discretion when it reviewed and reversed its previous ruling that was no longer questioned by any party since such act deviated from the applicable rules under the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the [COA] (RRPC) the Rules of Court, the doctrine of immutability of final judgments, and the principle of prospective overruling. In addition, Dela Calzada et al.'s rudimentary right to procedural due process was violated. it is settled, the obstinate disregard of basic and established rule of law or procedure constitutes grave abuse of discretion.\nThe COA Rules of Procedure was disregarded\nThe COA has set its own rules to modify or revise its judgments, decisions, and resolutions. Rule X, Section 12, in relation to Rule X Sections 9 and 10 of the RRPC, as amended, requires the aggrieved party to file a motion for reconsideration for the COA Proper to review its decision or a petition for certiorari for judicial review; otherwise, the decision becomes final and executory upon the lapse of 30 days from notice. The motion, as required under Section 11 of the same Rule must be \"verified and x x x [must] point out specifically the findings or conclusions of the decision which are not supported by evidence or which are contrary to law, making express reference to the testimonial or documentary evidence or the provisions of law that such finding or conclusions are alleged to be contrary to.\"\nAlthough the COA Proper is authorized to motu proprio exercise its power of review, i.e., even sans appeal or motion from any party, it is only to review the decision of the COA Director which is in conflict with the Auditor's issuance. This is an internal procedure for the COA to ensure the uniformity of its officers' rulings before the decision becomes final. In all other cases of review, the COA Proper is not authorized under its rules to act motu proprio.\nHere, no motion for reconsideration was filed as regards petitioners' liability since they were already absolved, but the COA Proper still reviewed and, worse, reversed its previous ruling. The COA Proper expediently assumed that Uy, as the incumbent regional director, represented the entire NEDA Caraga, including Dela Calzada et al., in the Partial Motion for Reconsideration. This assumption is erroneous because Dela Calzada et al. are not parties to the Partial Motion for Reconsideration. The caption of the motion specifically stated the names of the \"movants-appellants:\" Cochingco, Derequito, Sells, Casurra, and Dy, \"represented by incumbent Regional Director [Uy].\" Furthermore, the arguments in the motion discussed only the officers' liability. The officers prayed that they be exempt from reimbursement of the disallowed amount or, in the alternative, they be made to refund only the amount each of them received. Except for iterating petitioners' absolution, no other allegation or argument was raised as regards petitioners' liability. Finally, Dela Calzada et al. never authorized Uy to represent them in any case, unlike Cochingco, Derequito, Cassura, and Dy, who executed separate special power of attorneys expressly designating Uy as their attorney-in-fact in the Partial Motion for Reconsideration.\nClearly, from the foregoing, the COA Proper disregarded its own rules of procedure when it unilaterally reversed its ruling anent Dela Calzada et al.'s exemption from liability. As the COA Proper acted in a manner not sanctioned by the RRPC and such act affected petitioners' substantive right to property, its invalidation is warranted.\nThe Rules of Court allows partial reconsideration\nThe OSG argues that every disallowance entails a corresponding liability on every person who participated in the transactionwhether as an approving and\/or certifying officer or a mere recipientand all issues arising from a disallowance must be determined jointly. In précis, the OSG maintains that the determination of the validity of the ND cannot be separated from the discussion on the rules of return of the disallowed amount. If an ND is sustained, all persons liable to settle the disallowed amount must be determined as a matter of course. Further, the solidary nature of the liability in disallowances between recipients and the approving and\/or certifying officers bolsters the argument that such matters are inseparable.\nThe OSG is mistaken.\n\"[W]hen matters, issues, or claims can properly and conveniently be separately resolved,\" Rule 37, Section 7 of the Rules of Court permits division of judgments, i.e., a portion may be considered final and unappealable while another portion is pending appeal or reconsideration. The Rule states:\nSEC. 7. Partial New Trial or Reconsideration.  If the grounds for a motion under this Rule appear to the court to affect the issues as to only a part, or less than all of the matter in controversy, or only one, or less than all, of the parties to it, the court may order a new trial or grant reconsideration as to such issues if severable without interfering with the judgment or final order upon the rest. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe issue on the validity of the ND is severable from the issue on petitioners' liability because whether the ND is affirmed or otherwise struck down as invalid on the officers' Partial Motion for Reconsideration, such ruling is no longer consequential upon petitioners because they had already been taken out of the picture by being absolved from any liability under the ND.\nIn the same vein, despite its unique solidary nature, the determination of whether an approving and\/or certifying officer should be held liable in a disallowance is not dependent upon the determination of the recipients' liability because the grounds by which their liabilities arise are distinct. To elucidate, We have settled in Madera v. Commission on Audit that mere receipt of public funds without valid basis or justification gives rise to the obligation to return what was unduly received; but note that Madera also introduced jurisprudentially-recognized grounds which may excuse some or all of the recipients from such obligation. On the other hand, approving and\/or certifying officers of a disallowed amount may be held civilly, administratively, and\/or criminally liable upon proof that their act was tainted with bad faith, malice, or gross negligence. Clearly, the liabilities of the two sets of participants in a disallowance arise from two distinct sourcesthe recipients' liability arise from the civil law principles of unjust enrichment and solutio indebiti, while that of the officers' arise from public accountability. The two liabilities become relevant to each other only when it comes to the execution of the civil obligation to refund through the application of the concept of \"net disallowed amount\" as laid down in Madera, i.e., exemption of recipients from liability tempers the officers' civil liability in that the amount to be refunded shall be limited to that which remains unexcused.\nVerily, contrary to the OSG's contention, the existence and extent of the officers' liability may be determined independently from the final judgment excusing petitioners from liability. Consistent with its own rules of procedure, as well as the Rules of Court, the COA Proper should have limited its resolution to the issue\/s raised in the Partial Motion for Reconsideration.\nPetitioners' exoneration has become final\nSince no party questioned the COA Proper's affirmance of petitioners' exemption from liability, judgment on that matter undeniably lapsed into finality pursuant to Rule X, Section 9 of the RRPC, as amended. It is well­-established, a judgment becomes final and executory by operation of law. Finality becomes a fact when the reglementary period to question the judgment lapses and no such question was lodged. As a consequence, no court or tribunal (not even this Court) can review or modify a judgment that has become final. Our pronouncement in One Shipping Corp. v. Peñafiel is apropros:\nIn Aliviado v. Procter and Gamble Phils., Inc., [we ruled]:\nIt is a hornbook rule that once a judgment has become final and executory, it may no longer be modified in my respect, even if the modification is meant to correct an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land, as what remains to be done is the purely ministerial enforcement or execution of the judgment.\nThe doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice at the risk of occasional errors, the judgment of adjudicating bodies must become final and executory on some definite date fixed by law. [...], the Supreme Court reiterated that the doctrine of immutability of judgment is adhered to by necessity notwithstanding occasional errors that may result thereby, since litigations must somehow come to an end for otherwise, it would \"even be more intolerable than the wrong and injustice it is designed to correct.\"\n[Also,] [i]n Mocorro, Jr. v. Ramirez, we held that:\nA definitive final judgment, however erroneous, is no longer subject to change or revision.\nA decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable. This quality of immutability precludes the modification of a final judgment, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law. And this postulate holds true whether the modification is made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court in the land. The orderly administration of justice requires that, at the risk of occasional errors, the judgments\/resolutions of a court must reach a point of finality set by the law. The noble purpose is to write finis to dispute once and for all. This is a fundamental principle in our justice system, without which there would be no end to litigations. 1aшphi1 Utmost respect and adherence to this principle must always be maintained by those who exercise the power of adjudication. Any act, which violates such principle, must immediately be struck down. Indeed, the principle of conclusiveness of prior adjudications is not confined in its operation to the judgments of what are ordinarily known as courts, but extends to all bodies upon which judicial powers bad been conferred. (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)\nWe stress, not even this Court can re-assess, much less alter, a final judgment, especially when such ruling was not challenged before the forum. As we have held in Philippine Mining Development Corp. v. Aguinaldo:\nIn Securities and Exchange Commission v. Commission on Audit, this Court, sitting En Banc, resolved not to rule on the merits of the civil liability of the payee-recipients who were already exonerated from liability by the COA, especially since such absolution was not questioned before this Court[.]\n....\nThe particular circumstances (sic) is similar to [ Securities and Exchange Commission ]. To recall, the COA-CP similarly excluded the recipient employees from refunding the medical benefits they received. While they were absolved on the basis of good faith as abandoned in Madera, this Court must give due deference to the doctrine of finality of judgments, considering that their corresponding liability was no longer raised as an issue in the instant petition. Concomitantly, in [ Securities and Exchange Commission, ] the Court affirmed the COA-CP Decision, excusing the passive payees from returning the disallowed amounts on the ground of having received the same in good faith. Since their liability was no longer questioned or put in issue in the instant petition, this Court considered the COA-CP's Decision \"final and immutable.\"\nConsistently, this Court shares the observation of Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas-Bernabe ( Justice Perlas-Bernabe ) that there is no cogent reason to deviate from the prevailing rule that when the payee­-recipients have already been finally absolved from civil liability by the COA, the merits of such absolution should be respected and not touched upon by the Court in an appeal filed by the approving or certifying officers, who in contrast, were held liable under the subject disallowances. As such, this Court maintains the absolution of herein recipient employees pursuant to the finality of judgment as elucidated in the earlier rulings of SSS and SEC. (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)\nAlbeit the cited case deals with the Court's review power and not the COA Proper's motu proprio review of its unquestioned ruling as in this case, the same rationale that precludes review applies in this case, i.e., parties who do not challenge a favorable ruling for obvious reasons can no longer be prejudiced by a subsequent unilateral review. As aptly remarked by Justice Japar B. Dimaampao during deliberations, the basic tenets of fair play and due process, coupled with the severability of the issues involved, foreclose any amendment on the COA Proper's unchallenged ruling.\nJurisprudence applies prospectively\nUnrelenting to its cause, the OSG posits that this case falls within the exceptions to the doctrine of immutability of judgments, citing jurisprudential developments and the need to cure the inequitable allocation of liabilities as special and compelling reasons which justify the reversal of the otherwise final ruling of exemption on petitioners' liability.\nThis argument is misplaced.\n\"[W]hen a doctrine of this Court is overruled and a different view is adopted, the new doctrine should be applied prospectively, and should not apply to parties who had relied on the old doctrine and acted on the faith thereof.\" With more reason, a supervening doctrine cannot justify reversal of a final judgment. This is because:\n[P]ursuant to Article 8 of the Civil Code \"judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines.\" But while our decisions form part of the law of the land, they are also subject to Article 4 of the Civil Code which provides that \"laws shall have no retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided. This is expressed in the familiar legal maxim lex prospicit, non respicit, the law looks forward not backward. The rationale against retroactivity is easy to perceive. The retroactive application of a law usually divests rights that have already become vested or impairs the obligations of contract and hence, is unconstitutional.\nThus, it was arbitrary on the part of the COA Proper to reinstate petitioners' liability to apply the new precedentgood faith is no longer recognized as a justification to excuse recipients from liabilitywhen, at the time the previous ruling was issued and became final, prevailing jurisprudence says otherwise. To stress, Chozas v. Commission on Audit and all the other cases cited in that case, which was the basis of the COA Proper in reinstating petitioners' liability was promulgated in 2019 or after the COA Proper's previous ruling in 2018 had become final with respect to petitioners' liability. Too, it may not come amiss to note that it was only in Madera, promulgated in 2020, when the Court En Banc clarified the inapplicability of the good faith rule in excusing a recipient from liability in a disallowance. Verily, we cannot countenance a deviation from the time-honored doctrine of immutability of judgments only to violate the equally-recognized principle of prospective overruling.\nNeither would the nobility of addressing the inequitable consequence of petitioners' absolution validate the reversal of the final judgment because, as it happened, it only resulted in the arbitrary reinstatement of civil liability on the part of the petitioners. In any case, at this juncture, the application of the concept of net disallowed amount as laid down in Madera may address the inequitable burden upon the officers without resorting to the reversal of the final ruling on petitioners' exemption from liability.\nPetitioners' due process right was violated\nThe essence of procedural due process is embodied in the basic requirement of notice and a real opportunity to be heard. As we have held in Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas v. Commission on Audit:\nDue process in administrative proceedings does not require the submission of pleadings or a trial-type of hearing. [Nevertheless, it is imperative that] the party is duly notified of the allegations against him or her and is given the chance to present his or her defense. Furthermore, due process requires that the proffered defense should have been considered by the tribunal in arriving at its decision.\nHere, the Court observes that all throughout the proceedings before the COA, from the auditors, the NGS, and the COA Proper, all pleadings were filed by the officers. Dela Calzada et al. were exonerated at the NGS level, which was affirmed by the COA Proper. For obvious reasons, Dela Calzada et al. no longer posed any objection and they were no longer parties before the forum. However, in the subsequent motion for reconsideration filed solely by the officers, the COA Proper applied a new doctrine and unilaterally reinstated petitioners' liability. Such act clearly violated petitioners' right to due process since they were not given the opportunity to squarely and intelligently defend themselves from such new doctrine.\nIn all, the COA Proper gravely abused its discretion in unilaterally reversing its final judgmentbecause of its fervor to apply a supervening case law and to address the unfair distribution of liability, it arbitrarily disregarded the established rules on its review power, causing undue prejudice to petitioners. For this reason, the Court finds it unnecessary to delve on the other arguments raised in the Petition.\nACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED . The Decision No. 2021-491 (Resolution) dated December 22, 2021 of the Commission on Audit Proper is SET ASIDE insofar as petitioners Michelle P. Dela Calzada et al.'s liability under Notice of Disallowance No. 2013-01(2010-2012) was reinstated. Petitioners Michelle P.

XXX,[1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\nD E C I S I O N\nHERNANDO, J.:\nOn appeal is the September 15, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 11630 which affirmed the July 21, 2018 Decision of Regional Trial Court (RTC) of ███████, Branch 9 in Criminal Case No. 14-306468. The lower courts found accused-appellant XXX guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4 (a) and (e) in relation to Sec. 6 (a) and (c) of Republic Act No. (RA) 9208, otherwise known as the \"Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003,\" as amended by RA 10364.\nAccused-appellant was charged in an Information that reads:\nThat on or about the 28th day of January 2014, or on dates prior thereto at ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████, which is within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, for the purpose of prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation, did then and there, willfully, knowingly, unlawfully, feloniously provide the following minor children, namely: [AAA] (15 years old), [BBB] (13 years old), [CCC] (17 years old), and [DDD] (16 years old), to potential customers in exchange for sexual services for a fee, to the damage and prejudice of said minor children.\nThat the crime was further attended by the qualifying circumstance of large scale, there being four (4) victims at the time of the commission of the offense.\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\nDuring arraignment, accused-appellant entered a plea of \"not guilty.\" At the pre-trial conference, the prosecution and defense stipulated that accused­-appellant or the person named in the Information is the same person inside the court room, and that the accused was arrested, booked, and presented for inquest.\nThe prosecution presented the following witnesses: private complainants AAA, BBB, CCC, and DDD; and Intelligence Agents (I As) Victor John Paul Ronquillo (Ronquillo) and Rodrigo Sarno (Sarno). The defense presented accused-appellant as sole witness. The prosecution also formally offered the following documentary evidence: Sinumpaang Salaysay of CCC; Sinumpaang Salaysay of BBB; Joint Affidavit of Arrest; Sinumpaang Salaysay of DDD; Joint Affidavit of IA Sarno, IA Harold D. Natalia (Natalia), and IT Consultant Christian Andrew Ibasco (Ibasco); Sinumpaang Salaysay of AAA; marked money; Birth Certificate of DDD; and Birth Certificate of CCC.\nThe Facts\nOn January 27, 2014, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Anti­Human Trafficking Division (AHTRAD) Office received information about the rampant sexual trafficking of minors at ███████. Executive Officer Atty. Czar Eric Nuqui (Atty. Nuqui) ordered I As Sarno and Natalia to validate such information and conduct a surveillance operation at the said mall on the same day, at about 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.\nI As Sarno and Natalia proceeded to ███████ located on the ███████ and roamed around the area until a man, who was later identified as accused-appellant, approached the agents and asked them if they were looking for women to have sex with in exchange for money. The man even introduced to them a young girl who appeared to be a minor and told them that sex with her would only cost P1,000.. The agents replied that they are willing to accept his offer but, since they do not have money, they will come back another time.\nAfter confirming that there are indeed cases of sexual trafficking of minors in the area, the agents immediately returned to their office and reported the result of the surveillance to Atty. Nuqui. Atty. Nuqui ordered an entrapment and rescue operation the following day, January 28, 2014. The operation involved NBI AHTRAD agents, Department of Justice Inter-Agency Council against Trafficking agents, and Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) personnel. During the pre-operation briefing, IA Sarno, IA Natalia and Ibasco were designated as poseur customers and were given marked money consisting of five PHP 1,000. bills.\nOn January 28, 2014, at about 4:00 p.m., the entrapment team proceeded to the target area and waited outside ███████. Accused-appellant approached the poseur customers and once again offered the sexual services of minors at P1,000. each. The poseur customers agreed. Accused-appellant then instructed DDD to look for other girls and inform them that the \"guests\" were willing to pay ₱1,000. for their services. The complainants confirmed that accused-appellant served as their pimp or \"bugaw\" because he looked for \"guests\" who will pay for sexual services and that, according to their arrangement with accused-appellant, they must give the latter ₱200. to ₱300. from the ₱1000. they will receive from the \"guests.\"\nAfter offering several girls to the agents, the agents invited everyone to go down to a restaurant on the ground floor to eat. A certain YYY joined them in the restaurant hoping to offer to the agents the sexual services of another girl. In the restaurant, they ordered food and discussed the transaction. When accused-appellant told the poseur customers to choose among the girls who they will hire, IA Sarno chose the four girls brought by accused-appellant and paid P4,000. while IA Natalia chose the person brought by YYY and paid ₱1,000.. At this juncture, Atty. Nuqui signaled to the other agents to proceed with the arrest of the accused-appellant by nodding his head. IA Ronquillo, and other members of the team strategically positioned around the area, arrested accused-appellant while DSWD personnel rescued and took custody of the minor complainants.\nAs his defense, accused-appellant claimed that, on June 28, 2014, at about 3:00 p.m., he was shopping alone in ███████, when two individuals called his attention. The two individuals in civilian clothing invited accused-appellant to eat with them at a restaurant in the mall. After they finished eating, the men instructed accused-appellant to leave the restaurant. Accused-appellant claimed that, after he left the restaurant, he was forced to board a van and was brought to the NBI Office. Accused-appellant testified that he does not know the complainants in the present case and he has no knowledge of the reason why he was charged with exploiting minors.\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court\nIn its July 21, 2018 Judgment, the trial court rendered a decision finding accused-appellant guilty of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Sec. 4 (a) and (e) in relation to Sec. 6 (a) and (c) of RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364. The trial court found that the statements of the victims positively identifying the accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime charged were credible, concise, straightforward, and unperturbed by rigorous cross-examination. The dispositive portion of the RTC judgment reads:\nWHEREFORE, accused [XXX] [sic] is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Trafficking of Persons under Section 4(a) and (e) in relation to Section 6(a) and (c) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003), as amended by R.A. No. 10364. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, without eligibility for parole, and to pay a fine of P2,000,000..\nSO ORDERED.\nAccused-appellant appealed his conviction to the appellate court on July 26, 2018. In the Appellant's Brief, accused-appellant claimed that the trial court erred in convicting him of the crime charged despite the \"patent incredibility and inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.\"\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\nIn its September 15, 2020 Decision, the CA affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction. The CA held that the prosecution clearly established the existence of the elements of Qualified Trafficking in Persons in this case, and found that the alleged inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses pertained to minor details that, in any case, could not negate accused-­appellant's violation of RA 9208, as amended. The fallo of the CA's September 15, 2020 Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED . The decision of the Regional Trial Court of ███████, Branch 09 dated July 21, 2018 in Criminal Case No. 14-306468 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION . Accused-appellant [XXX] is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons, defined and penalized under Section 4 (a) and (e) in relation to Section 6 (a) and (c) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended by Republic Act No. 10364. Accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and pay a fine in the amount of P2,000,000.. Accused-appellant is also ordered to pay each of the four victims named in the information the amount of P500,000. as moral damages and P100,000. as exemplary damages, with interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum on all monetary awards from the date of finality of judgment until full payment. 1aшphi1\nSO ORDERED.\nAggrieved, accused-appellant filed a Notice of Appeal on October 21, 2020 challenging the assailed decision of the CA.\nIssue\nFor resolution is the issue of whether the CA correctly affirmed the finding of the RTC that accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Sec. 4 (a) and (e) in relation to Sec. 6 (a) and (c) of RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364.\nOur Ruling\nThe appeal has no merit. The Court sustains the conviction of accused-­appellant for the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons, particularly under Sec. 4 (a) and (e) in relation to Sec. 6 (a) of RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364.\nIn order to sustain a conviction for \"Trafficking in Persons,\" the following elements must be shown:\n(1) The act of \"recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders;\"\n(2) The means used which include \"threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another;\" and\n(3) The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes \"exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.\"\nThe foregoing elements were culled from the definition of \"Trafficking in Persons\" under Sec. 3 (a) of RA 9208. In Arambulo v. People, the Court clarified that Sec. 3 (a) of RA 9208 merely provides the general definition of \"Trafficking in Persons\" and that convictions for \"Qualified Trafficking in Persons\" shall rest on (a) the commission of any of the acts provided under Secs. 4, 4-A, 4-B, 4-C, or 5; and (b) the existence of any of the circumstances listed under Section 6:\nIt must be clarified that Section 3 (a) of RA 9208 merely provides for the general definition of 'Trafficking in Persons' as the specific acts punishable under the law are found in Sections 4 and 5 of the same (including Sections 4-A, 4-B, and 4-C if the amendments brought about by RA 10364 are taken into consideration). This is evinced by Section 10 which provides for the penalties and sanctions for committing the enumerated acts therein. Notably, Section IO (c) of RA 9208 (renumbered as Section 10 [e] under RA 10364) of the law also provides for penalties for 'Qualified Trafficking in Persons' under Section 6. Nonetheless, since Section 6 only provides for circumstances which would qualify the crime of 'Human Trafficking,' reference should always be made to Sections 4, 4-A, 4-B, 4-C, or 5 of the law. Hence, convictions for 'Qualified Trafficking in Persons' shall rest on: (a) the commission of any of the acts provided under Sections 4, 4-A, 4-B, 4-C, or S; and (b) the existence of any of the circumstances listed under Section 6. Otherwise stated, one cannot be convicted of 'Qualified Trafficking in Persons' if he is not found to have committed any of the punishable acts under the law.\"\nIn the present case, accused-appellant is charged with the violation of Sec. 4 (a) and (e) in relation to Sec. 6 (a) and (c) of RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364:\nSec. 4. Acts of Trafficking in Persons. - It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:\n(a) To recruit, obtain, hire, provide, offer, transport, transfer, maintain, harbor, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, or sexual exploitation;\nx x x x\n(e) To maintain or hire a person to engage in prostitution or pornography;\nx x x x\nSec. 6. Qualified Trafficking in Persons. - The following are considered as qualified trafficking:\n(a) When the trafficked person is a child;\nx x x x\n(c) When the crime is committed by a syndicate, or in large scale. Trafficking is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another. It is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons, individually or as a group;\nAs provided under Sec. 4 (a) of RA 9208, as amended, the prosecution must prove that accused-appellant (1) recruited, obtained, hired, provided, offered, transported, transferred, maintained, harbored, or received a person; (2) by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship; and (3) for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, or sexual exploitation. Under Sec. 4 (e) of RA 9208, as amended, the prosecution must show that accused-appellant maintained or hired a person to engage in prostitution or pornography. The foregoing acts are qualified if, among others, the prosecution shows that the trafficked person is a child [Section 6 (a)] and\/or the crime is committed by a syndicate or in a large scale [Section 6 (c)].\nAlthough the enumeration of elements of \"Trafficking in Persons\" provides that the means used include \"threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another,\" paragraph 2 of Sec. 3 (a) of RA 9208, as amended also provides that \"the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.\"\nIn every criminal case, the task of the prosecution is always two-fold: (1) to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of the crime charged; and (2) to establish with the same quantum of proof the identity of the person or persons responsible therefor, because, even if the commission of the crime is a given, there can be no conviction without the identity of the malefactor being likewise clearly ascertained. As correctly found by the courts a quo, the prosecution sufficiently established all the elements of the crime charged and also proved beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant is the perpetrator of the crime.\nThe prosecution witnesses clearly and convincingly narrated the events that transpired on the day of the incident. It was particularly established that (1) accused-appellant approached the agents and asked them if they were looking for women to have sex with in exchange for ₱1,000. for each girl and even asked the agents to choose who, among the girls he brought to them, they will hire; (2) accused-appellant offered DDD's services to a \"guest\" and then instructed her to look for more girls to give to the \"guests;\" and (3) all of the complainants confirmed that accused-appellant looked for \"guests\" who will pay for sexual services and that they must give accused-appellant ₱200. to ₱300. from the money that they will receive from the \"guests.\"\nFrom the foregoing testimonies, it is clear that the prosecution consistently showed that accused-appellant recruited or hired four young ladies for the purpose of prostitution or sexual exploitation and offered their sexual services to the poseur customers. Sec. 3(a) of RA 9208, as amended, clearly provides that such \"Trafficking in Persons\" may be committed \"with or without the victim's consent or knowledge.\" As to the means employed by accused­-appellant, Sec. 4 (a) notably provides that such act may be achieved \"by any means.\" Regardless of the complainants' consent to such transaction and even their past involvement in similar arrangements, accused-appellant took full advantage of their vulnerability when he hired them and offered their services to the poseur customers. Each complainant testified that they dropped out of school or stopped studying and that they willingly entered into such an illicit transaction with accused-appellant because of their need to support themselves. Such deplorable acts of the accused-appellant involving the sexual exploitation of four young ladies clearly fall under Sec. 4 (a) and (e) of RA 9208, as amended.\nAs to the qualifying circumstances, the prosecution alleges that the four complainants were all minors at the time of the incident. Sec. 3 (b) of RA 9208, as amended, defines \"child\" as a \"a person below eighteen (18) years of age or one who is over eighteen (18) but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself\/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.\"\nIn People v. Pruna, the court laid down the following guidelines in appreciating age either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance:\nIn order to remove any confusion that may be engendered by the foregoing cases, we hereby set the following guidelines in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance.\n1. The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.\n2. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as baptismal certificate and school records which show the date of birth of the victim would suffice to prove age.\n3. If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victim's mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:\na. If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;\nb. If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;\nc. If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 18 years old.\n4. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim's mother or relatives concerning the victim's age, the complainant's testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.\n5. It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him.\n6. The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim.\nBased on the records, the prosecution did not present sufficient evidence to prove the minority of the complainants. For AAA and BBB, the prosecution dispensed with the testimony of the representatives of the Philippine Statistic Authority (PSA), after the defense admitted that the PSA will present, among others, exhibits showing the Negative Certification of Record of Birth of AAA and the Negative Certification of Record of Birth of BBB. The prosecution did not present any other evidence to prove the minority of AAA and BBB.\nAs for DDD, the information states that she was 16 years old at the time of the incident. In her affidavit, she claimed that she was born in 1998 and that she was 16 years old. However, based on the birth certificate of DDD submitted into evidence by prosecution, the year of birth of DDD indicated therein is 1995. Thus, at the time of the incident, DDD was already 18 years old. As for CCC, the information states that she was 17 years old at the time. In her affidavit, she claimed that she was born in 1996 and that she was 17 years old. However, the birth certificate of CCC presented by the prosecution states that her year of birth was in 1968. Upon closer inspection of the birth certificate of CCC on record, it appears that the same may refer to another person with a similar first name and last name but different middle name.\nFor failure of the prosecution to discharge the burden of proving the age of the offended parties, the qualifying circumstance under Sec. 6 (a) of RA 9208 cannot be appreciated in this case. Nonetheless, since the crime was committed in large scale or against four persons, the qualifying circumstance under Sec. 6 (c) of RA 9208 must be applied and the appropriate penalties must be imposed.\nWith regard to accused-appellant challenging the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, this Court has consistently held that the findings of the trial court are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect unless it \"overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which will alter the assailed decision or affect the result of the case:\"\nThe Court has ruled, time and again, that when the issues involve matters of credibility of witnesses, the findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies, and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings, are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect. This is so because it is the trial court that has the unique opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses; and the trial court is in the best position to discern whether or not the witnesses are telling the truth. Generally, the appellate courts will not overturn the trial court's findings unless it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which will alter the assailed decision or affect the result of the case.\nIt is well settled that inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses, which refer only to minor details and collateral matters, do not affect the veracity and weight of their testimonies, where there is consistency in relating the principal occurrence and the positive identification of the accused. The agent who served as poseur customer, IA Sarno, and the arresting officer, IA Ronquillo, as well as the four complainants all positively identified accused-appellant in open court open court as a \"bugaw\" or pimp, someone who looks for \"guests\" who will pay for sex with girls and receive a commission from the fees. Despite accused-appellant's insistence that YYY and even DDD should also be prosecuted for a similar criminal charge, this Court agrees with the findings of the appellate court that such contentions cannot be sustained as the prosecution of a criminal case is under the discretion and control of the prosecuting officer and DDD, in particular, was merely following the instructions of accused-­appellant to find more girls to entertain the \"guests.\" Moreover, the prosecution of other parties has no bearing on the case of accused-appellant since the latter was positively identified by the prosecution witnesses as the perpetrator of the crime charged. The defense also did not allege and prove any ill motive of the prosecution witnesses in testifying against the accused-appellant.\nIn contrast to the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution, accused-appellant merely denies knowing complainants in the present case and claims that he has no knowledge of the reason why he was charged with exploiting minors. An affirmative testimony is stronger than a negative testimony especially when the former comes from a credible witness. The defenses of alibi and denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are inherently weak, self-serving, and undeserving of weight in law. Hence, the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses must prevail over the self-­serving and unsubstantiated testimony of the defense. 1âшphi1\nWith regard to the penalty imposed by the lower courts, this Court affirms the imposition of the penalty of life imprisonment and fine in the amount of ₱2,000,000.. As provided under Sec. 10 (e) of RA 9208, as amended, \"any person found guilty of qualified trafficking under Sec. 6 shall suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than Two million pesos (₱2,000,000.) but not more than Five million pesos (₱5,000,000.).\" Pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence, accused-appellant must pay AAA, BBB, CCC, and DDD each the amounts of ₱500,000. as moral damages and ₱100,000. as exemplary damages, plus legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of judgment until full payment.\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED . The September 15, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 11630 is AFFIRMED in that accused-appellant XXX is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Trafficking in Persons, defined and penalized under Section 4 (a) and (e), in relation to Section 6 (c) of Republic Act No. 9208, as amended. Accordingly, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine in the amount of P2,000,000.. He is also ordered to pay the complainants, AAA, BBB, CCC, and DDD each the amounts of P500,000. as moral damages and P100,000. as exemplary damages.\nInterest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be imposed on the aggregate amount of the monetary awards computed from the finality of this Resolution until full payment.\nThe Manifestation (In Lieu of Supplemental Brief) by accused-appellant, is NOTED.\nSO ORDERED.\nGesmundo, C.J.

{"id":6028,"text":"Manila\nSECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 247339. March 13, 2023 ]\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM REPRESENTED BY THE HON. JOHN R. CASTRICIONES, PETITIONER, VS. LAPANDAY FOODS CORPORATION AND HIJO EMPLOYEES AGRARIAN REFORM BENEFICIARIES COOPERATIVE 1 [HEARBCO-1], RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nLEONEN, SAJ.:\nAn agrarian dispute refers to any controversy relating to tenurial arrangements over agricultural lands. However, when the issue centers around agreements on the produce from Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program covered agricultural lands, civil law provisions on contracts apply, and jurisdiction falls on regular courts, not the Department of Agrarian Reform.\nThis Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Department of Agrarian Reform, assailing the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals, which upheld the Orders of the Regional Trial Court denying the Department of Agrarian Reform's Motions to Quash Alias Writ of Execution and Immediate Referral and its Motion for Intervention and Reconsideration, respectively.\nThe facts, as borne by the records, show that sometime in 1995, Hijo Plantation, Inc. (Hijo Plantation) offered its property in Madaum, Tagum City, Davao del Norte, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. C-1118 with an area of 450. hectares, to the government's Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. The government purchased it for PHP 1. million per hectare.\nThe 567 identified and qualified agrarian reform beneficiaries of the subject property organized themselves into a cooperative named Hijo Employees Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative l (Hijo Cooperative).\nOn December 23, 1996, the government awarded the property to the Hijo Cooperative members, and the title was registered on June 22, 1998.\nOn October 18, 1999, Hijo Plantation and Hijo Cooperative entered into an agribusiness venture agreement and executed a Banana Sales and Marketing Agreement (The Agreement). The parties undertook that Hijo Cooperative grow and produce export-quality bananas, and then the Hijo Plantation would purchase them at an agreed price.\nThat same day, Hijo Plantation transferred its rights under the Agreement to Global Fruits Corporation, later renamed Lapanday Foods Corporation (Lapanday). The Agreement was extended until 2019.\nOn December 17, 2000, Lapanday and Hijo Cooperative executed a Banana Purchase Agreement, where Hijo Cooperative undertook to sell its Class B Cavendish bananas to Lapanday.\nSome Hijo Cooperative members opposed the agribusiness venture agreements entered with Lapanday. Thus, they broke away from the original cooperative and created their own group called Madaum Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association, Incorporated (Madaum Association). The 159 original agrarian reform beneficiaries left Hijo Cooperative to join the Madaum Association.\nLapanday charged the Madaum Association leaders and members with violating their contract.\nThe remaining Hijo Cooperative members executed a General Framework on Farm Rehabilitation, establishing the guidelines to follow in Lapanday's takeover of farm operations.\nLapanday then took over the land allotted to both Hijo Cooperative and Madaum Association members. It blocked the access and farm roads, securing the gates with armed guards. It also padlocked the harvesting swing gate, effectively preventing the delivery of harvested bananas to its packing houses.\nDeprived of access to Lapanday's packing houses, Hijo Cooperative members erected makeshift packing houses and sold their harvest to available buyers.\nOn July 2, 2010, Lapanday filed an action for specific performance before the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator, alleging that Hijo Cooperative refused to sell its bananas to Lapanday, despite the two agribusiness venture agreements between the parties. The Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator directed the parties to preserve the status quo ante.\nLapanday also filed a complaint for specific performance and damages with an application for writ of preliminary injunction against Hijo Cooperative and its then officers with the Regional Trial Court. The trial court issued a writ of preliminary injunction and required the parties to abide by the terms and conditions of their agreements.\nOn April 9, 2011, Lapanday and Hijo Cooperative entered into a compromise agreement, which the Regional Trial Court approved in its September 30, 2011 Decision.\nMeanwhile, the Madaum Association filed a Petition for Reinstatement, Accounting of Harvest and Damages against Hijo Cooperative before the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator.\nOn December 15, 2015, the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator granted Madaum Association's petition. Hijo Cooperative and Madaum Association then executed a Kasabutan, which the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator approved, and Madaum Association members were reinstated in the San Isidro Farm Area.\nMeanwhile, on February 20, 2014, the Hijo Cooperative filed a petition before the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council to revoke the Banana Purchase Agreement it executed with Lapanday.\nLapanday, in turn, moved to issue a writ of execution of the Regional Trial Court's September 30, 2011 Decision approving the compromise agreement.\nOn December 9, 2015, the Regional Trial Court issued a writ of execution.\nLapanday then alleged that the San Isidro Farm Area was part of its managing area, per its agreements with Hijo Cooperative, and applied for an alias writ of execution before the Regional Trial Court to enforce the terms of its compromise agreement with Hijo Cooperative.\nIn its November 2, 2016 Order, the Regional Trial Court issued the alias writ of execution prayed by Lapanday. The dispositive portion of the Order reads:\nWHEREFORE, considering the above premises, the Motion is hereby GRANTED . Let Alias Writ of Execution be immediately issued:\n1. Directing HEARBCO-1, its assigns, and anyone acting in its behalf to respect, honor and comply with the Compromise Agreement dated 9 September 2011;\n2. Directing the Sheriff with the assistance of the Philippine National Police (PNP) to disperse the barricading members of HEARBCO-1;\n3. Deputizing the Philippine National Police (PNP) to assist in the execution of the writ;\n4. Authorizing Sheriff Robert Medialdea of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 15 to implement the Alias Writ of Execution.\nSO ORDERED.\nOn December 12, 2016, Lapanday security guards shot some Madaum Association members, prompting the Department of Agrarian Reform to issue a cease-and-desist order two days later to maintain the peace.\nLapanday filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals against the Department of Agrarian Reform to restrain the latter from enforcing the cease and desist order. 1aшphi1 However, its petition was denied, and the Court of Appeals recognized the necessity of the cease and desist order to maintain the peace and order in the San Isidro Farm Area.\nOn December 21, 2016, the Department of Agrarian Reform moved to quash the alias writ of execution, arguing that it had the primary and exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving agrarian law implementation and agrarian disputes.\nIn its April 18, 2017 Order, the Regional Trial Court denied the motion to quash, pointing out that the compromise agreement sought to be enforced has long become final and executory. Further, it stressed that the Department of Agrarian Reform had no standing to intervene because the controversy arose not from an agrarian dispute but from implementing a compromise agreement.\nThe Department of Agrarian Reform then filed a motion to intervene with leave of court and motion for reconsideration, which the Regional Trial Court likewise denied.\nThe Department of Agrarian Reform thereafter filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals, which was denied in its January 28, 2019 Decision.\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that there was no agrarian dispute as the controversy originated from the agribusiness venture agreements entered into by Hijo Cooperative and Lapanday's predecessor-in-interest, ensuring the compromise agreement between the parties.\nThe Court of Appeals also stated that the Department of Agrarian Reform's cease and desist order did not convert the case into an agrarian dispute, nor can it be considered a supervening event that would render the implementation of the compromise agreement inequitable.\nThe dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision reads:\nALL TOLD, this Court's consideration of the issues raised by petitioner, as well as, a review of the records before Us failed to establish grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 14 of Davao City in issuing the Orders of the Regional Trial Court, dated April 18, 2017 and August 15, 2017.\nThe Petition for Certiorari is hereby DENIED .\nSO ORDERED.\nThe Department of Agrarian Reform sought for reconsideration of the Court of Appeals Decision, but its motion was denied on May 10, 2019. In denying the motion for reconsideration, the Court of Appeals reiterated that the case did not involve \"any issue on tenurial arrangement or compensation of agricultural lands or terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowners to farm workers\" but was for specific performance and damages.\nHence, petitioner Department of Agrarian Reform filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before this Court.\nPetitioner asserts that an agrarian dispute was present as Madaum Association members were removed from the San Isidro Farm Area due to the enforcement of the alias writ of execution implementing the compromise agreement.\nPetitioner continues that while the interpretation and enforcement of the compromise agreement \"do not per se constitute an agrarian dispute\", the agrarian dispute arose when the Madaum Association members were prevented from exercising their tenurial rights due to the implementation of the alias writ of execution.\nPetitioner likewise states that the agribusiness venture agreements between private respondents Hijo Cooperative and Lapanday were governed by the Department of Agrarian Reform Administrative Order No. 9, Series of 2006 or the Revised Rules and Regulations Governing Agribusiness Venture Arrangements in Agrarian Reform Areas, which provided for mechanisms for disputes arising from the execution of agribusiness venture arrangements.\nPetitioner then emphasizes that the Revised Rules and Regulations provided for resorting to alternative modes of dispute resolution such as mediation and arbitration. Then if the alternative modes of dispute resolution failed, jurisdiction fell on the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board to interpret and enforce the agribusiness venture agreement.\nFinally, petitioner points out that there was a pending petition for the cancellation of the Banana Purchase Agreement between private respondents Hijo Cooperative and Lapanday before the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council, being the body with \"the power and authority to cancel or revoke and terminate agribusiness venture arrangement contracts.\" It stresses that the Regional Trial Court disregarded the assumption of jurisdiction of the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council when it issued the alias writ of execution.\nIn its Comment, private respondent Lapanday maintains that the petition should be dismissed outright because it was not sent to its counsel's correct address and it was filed without proper authority. Further, private respondent Lapanday asserts that petitioner did not have the requisite legal standing to file the petition because it was not a party to the compromise agreement between private respondents Lapanday and Hijo Cooperative, and neither is it an indispensable party to the proceedings.\nPrivate respondent Lapanday then asseverates that the controversy did not involve an agrarian dispute; hence, jurisdiction rightfully lay with the Regional Trial Court, not petitioner. It also maintains that the issuance of a cease and desist order did not convert the case into an agrarian dispute, especially since the compromise agreement was approved years before the cease and desist order issuance.\nOn the other hand, private respondents Mely Yu, Gilberto A. Gastones, Carlos V. Guadalquiver, Elizabeth S. Villarosa, Linda G. Dayahan, Antonio L. Tuyak, Felipe A. Dispo, Salvador M. Barcebal, Jr., and Antonio J. Sang-an in their Comment posit that the case involves an agrarian dispute which requires a referral to petitioner. They also stress that petitioner, with its exclusive jurisdiction on agrarian disputes, has the mandate to determine the existence of an agrarian dispute initially and that the trial courts do not have the same authority.\nPrivate respondents contend that there was an agrarian dispute because the agrarian reform beneficiaries were ousted from their landholdings with the issuance of the writ of alias execution.\nFinally, private respondents put forth that the writ of alias execution has no legal effect because it enforces a void judgment and collides with the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary's cease and desist order.\nThe issues to be resolved by this Court's resolution are whether petitioner Department of Agrarian Reform can intervene in an action for specific performance and damages over a compromise agreement on the fruits of a land awarded to agrarian reform beneficiaries through the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law; and whether the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the Compromise Agreement between private respondents Lapanday Food Corporations and Hijo Employees Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative 1.\nThe Petition is unmeritorious. 1âшphi1\nSection 3(d) of Republic Act No. 6657 defines agrarian dispute as those relating to tenurial arrangements, thus:\nSECTION 3. Definitions. - For the purpose of this Act, unless the context indicates otherwise:\n. . . .\n(d) Agrarian Dispute refers to any controversy relating to tenurial arrangements, whether leasehold, tenancy, stewardship or otherwise, over lands devoted to agriculture, including disputes concerning farmworkers' associations or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of such tenurial arrangements.\nIt includes any controversy relating to compensation of lands acquired under this Act and other terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowners to farmworkers, tenants and other agrarian reform beneficiaries, whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of farm operator and beneficiary, landowner and tenant, or lessor and lessee.\nRepublic Act No. 6657 then empowers petitioner with \"the primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters'' as well as the implementation of agrarian reform.\nHere, petitioner insists on its right to intervene in the case for specific performance and damages between respondents because the removal of the Madaum Association members, who were agrarian reform beneficiaries, from the San Isidro Farm Area due to the enforcement of the alias writ of execution implementing the compromise agreement purportedly created an agrarian dispute.\nPetitioner fails to convince.\nThe issue presented here is not novel and has already been taken up in Stanfilco Employees Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Multi-Purpose Cooperative v. Dole Phils.\nIn Stanfilco, a cooperative composed of agrarian reform beneficiaries, entered into a production and exclusive purchase agreement over its harvested bananas with DOLE Philippines, Inc. After a few years, the DOLE Philippines, Inc. accused the cooperative of violating their agreement when it sold its rejected bananas to DOLE Philippines, Inc.'s competitor. The DOLE Philippines, Inc. then filed a complaint for specific performance and damages against the cooperative.\nThe cooperative moved for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, claiming that the issue involved an agrarian dispute. Hence, jurisdiction properly lies with the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board.\nThe Regional Trial Court and Court of Appeals both ruled that the case did not involve an agrarian conflict and was instead a judicial matter.\nStanfilco upheld the findings of the lower courts and pointed out that no tenancy relationship subsisted between the parties. It also pointed out that the validity of the agreement entered into was not in question. Instead, the resolution required \"the application of civil law provisions on breaches of contract, rather than agrarian reform principles.\"\nHere, there was no tenancy relationship subsisting between respondents, with private respondent Hijo Cooperative maintaining ownership of the land and only allowing private respondent Lapanday to manage part of the awarded land in the compromise agreement.\nPrivate respondent Lapanday filed a complaint for specific performance with a request for a warrant of alias execution when private respondent Hijo Cooperative refused to abide by the terms of its judicially approved compromise agreement, which had been approved by a court.\nSpecific performance is \"[t]he remedy of requiring exact performance of a contract in the specific form in which it was made, or according to the precise terms agreed upon. [It is t]he actual accomplishment of a contract by a party bound to fulfill it.\" The remedy of specific performance requires the interpretation of civil law provisions on contracts. For an action of specific performance to succeed, it must be proven that one of the parties committed a breach of the contract.\nIt is not disputed that private respondents Hijo Cooperative and Lapanday freely entered into a compromise agreement which the Regional Trial Court judicially approved on September 30, 2011.\nA judgment on a compromise agreement has the effect of res judicata and is immediately final and executory, as it is considered a judgment on the merits. Nonetheless, the doctrine of immutability of compromise agreements admits a few exceptions to serve substantial justice. However, the subsequent refusal of some of private respondent Hijo Cooperative's members to abide by the judicially approved compromise agreement is not a supervening event that would render its execution unjust and inequitable.\nClearly, the issues to be resolved in the present case for specific performance do not involve an agrarian dispute which would require petitioner's intervention. As in Stanfilco, the resolution of the case at bar requires \"the application of civil law provisions on breaches of contract, rather than agrarian reform principles.\"\nThe lower courts thus did not err in denying petitioner's motion to intervene since there is no agrarian dispute to be resolved in the case at bar. They also did not err in upholding the final and executory compromise agreement between private respondents. As the Court of Appeals correctly observed:\nThe case does not involve any issue on tenurial arrangement or compensation of agricultural lands or terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowners to farm workers. The only issue involved is whether or not HEARBCO-1 and the named individual defendants are liable for damages to Lapanday Food Corporation by reason of breach of contract. And as We have already held, reference would only have to be made on the relevant provisions of the New Civil Code relating to contracts, damages[,] and human relations.\nThe case before the RTC was for specific performance of the [Banana Sales and Marketing Agreement] and [Banana Purchase Agreement] between Lapanday and HEARBCO-1. To reiterate, the parties later on decided to end the litigation by making reciprocal concessions in their compromise agreement. One of the concessions in the compromise agreement was for HEARBCO-1 to abide by its contractual obligations to exclusively sell all its banana produce to Lapanday and to give the latter the right to manage a certain portion of HEARBCO-1's banana plantation. When Lapanday sought the issuance of the writ of execution and the alias writ of execution, it merely sought compliance from HEARBCO-1 and all its members. It is the same subject matter of the case and the same subject matter of the judgment that became final and executory.

{"id":6030,"text":"Manila\nSECOND DIVISION\n[ A.C. No. 13219 (Formerly CBD Case No. 18-5598), March 27, 2023 ]\nIN RE: G.R. NOS. 226935, 228238, AND 228325, VS. ATTY. RICHARD R. ENOJO, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nKHO, JR., J.:\nThis administrative case arose from a Petition to Disbar respondent Atty. Richard R. Enojo filed by the people of Negros Oriental, through Godofredo Renacia (Renacia), who was a movant in the consolidated cases before the Court docketed as G.R. No. 226935 ( June Vincent Manuel S. Gaudan v. Roel R. Degamo ), G.R. No. 228238 ( Office of the Ombudsman v. Roel R. Degamo ) and G.R. No. 228325 ( June Vincent Manuel S. Gaudan v. Roel R. Degamo ).\nRespondent was appointed provincial legal officer of Negros Oriental sometime in January 2011. On October 29, 2013, June Vincent Manuel S. Gaudan (Gaudan) filed criminal and administrative cases before the Ombudsman against then-Governor of Negros Oriental, Roel R. Degamo (Degamo). In these cases, respondent appeared as counsel for Degamo. When the cases reached the Sandiganbayan upon the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to charge Degamo and other public officials with malversation of public funds, respondent also entered his appearance as counsel for Degamo. The prosecution then opposed respondent's appearance, arguing that it is not among respondent's duties as provincial legal officer to represent the province's public officials who are charged with criminal cases. The Sandiganbayan ruled in favor of the prosecution and ordered respondent to desist from appearing as counsel for Degamo. Respondent was then replaced as counsel for Degamo.\nAt the same time, the Ombudsmans finding of administrative liability was assailed before the Court of Appeals (CA) and eventually reached the Court through the cases docketed as G.R. Nos. 226935, 228325, and 228238. Respondent represented Degamo before the Court as well. It was in these proceedings where the Petition to Disbar Atty. Richard Enojo was filed.\nOn June 4, 2018, the Director for Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Commission, on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) directed respondent to file his answer to the complaint. On August 14, 2018, respondent filed his answer, arguing that under the Local Government Code, the prohibition from appearing as counsel in criminal cases against an officer or employee of the national and local government for offenses committed in relation to their office is imposed, not on appointive legal officers, but on Sanggunian members, who are elective public officials. He claimed that his functions as provincial legal officer, the Local Government Code purportedly authorize him to \"defend the LGU's [local government unit] officers and employees who are sued in relation to or affecting the discharge of their official functions.\" Finally, he argues that the Court En Banc 's ruling in Urbano v. Chavez, through Associate Justice Emilio A. Gancayco, does not apply to him since he is not part of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). In Urbano, the Court held that the OSG is not authorized to represent a public official at any stage of a criminal case.\nOn November 15, 2019, the case was set for mandatory conference, where only respondent appeared and filed a Conference Brief. Thereafter, the IBP-CBD directed the parties to file their verified position papers. The records show that both parties did not file their position papers.\nThe IBP Report and Recommendation\nIn a Report and Recommendation dated June 4, 2020, the IBP-CBD recommended the dismissal of the complaint for lack of merit. In so recommending, the IBP-CBD noted that at most, respondent was guilty of an erroneous interpretation of the law. It found that contrary to respondent's argument, the Sandiganbayan had already ruled that it was in fact not part of respondent's duties to appear as counsel for public officials who are accused in criminal cases. The IBP-CBD also noted that at present there is no law that positively prohibits the respondent from handling the case of his Governor. I[n] fact, it even took the case of Urbano to finally settle the issue of the appearance of the Solicitor General. Such Decision of the Supreme Court does not specifically refer to [a] provincial legal officer. In fact, in the Resolution of the Honorable Sandiganbayan, the said case was only applied by inference.\"\nIn its Resolution dated March 13, 2021, the Board of Governors of the IBP resolved to adopt and approve the Report and Recommendation. 1aшphi1\nThe Issue Before the Court\nThe issue before the Court is whether respondent should be held administratively liable for the acts complained of.\nThe Court's Ruling\nAfter a careful study and review of the records, the Court overturns the findings and recommendations of the IBP. As will be explained hereunder, respondent engaged in an unauthorized practice of law and must be held administratively liable therefor.\nI 1aшphi1 .\nAt the time the Petition to Disbar was filed, respondent was a government lawyer, employed as provincial legal officer of Negros Oriental. However, the fact that he is in government service will not preclude the Court from disciplining him as a member of the Bar, should circumstances so warrant. It bears emphasizing that \"[t]he Code of Professional Responsibility does not cease to apply to a lawyer simply because he has joined the government service. In fact, by the express provision of Canon 6 thereof, the rules governing the conduct of lawyers 'shall apply to lawyers in government service in the discharge of their official tasks.' Thus, where a lawyer's misconduct as a government official is of such nature as to affect his qualification as a lawyer or to show moral delinquency, then he may be disciplined as a member of the bar on such grounds.\"\nNotably, in Vitriolo v. Dasig, the Court instructed that when the misconduct of government official also constitutes as a violation of one's oath as a lawyer, such lawyer may be disciplined by the Court as a member of the Bar. The Court reasoned that \"a member of the Bar who assumes public office does not shed his professional obligations. [The] Code of Professional Responsibility was not meant to govern the conduct of private practitioners alone, but of all lawyers including those in government service.\"\nAt this juncture, it is well to point out that the Court's power to discipline erring lawyers stems from none other than its exclusive constitutional authority to regulate the practice of law under Article VIII, Section 5(5), of the 1987 Constitution. In the case of In re: Cunanan, it was held that \"[i]t is ... the primary and inherent prerogative of the Supreme Court to render the ultimate decision on who may be admitted and may continue in the practice of law according to existing rules.\" It was further declared that \"[i]n the judicial system from which ours has been evolved, the admission, suspension, disbarment, and reinstatement of attorneys at law in the practice of profession and their supervision have been indisputably a judicial function and responsibility.\"\nThe fact that a lawyer is a public official does not in any way, diminish or modify the Supreme Court's constitutionally vested authority to regulate the practice of law, which necessarily includes the power to discipline erring lawyers. It must be borne in mind that there is a clear substantive bifurcation between the legal profession and public service. Each is governed by different standards and bodies of rules whose regulation and administration fall under separate entities of government. Accordingly, the personality of one being sued for ethical violations as a lawyer should be treated separately and distinctly from the personality of one being sued for administrative violations as a public servant. By constitutional force, cases concerning the former is within the exclusive realm of the Supreme Court. To make any qualification on the Supreme Court's jurisdiction in this respect is to diminish its constitutionally vested powers.\nCognizant of the foregoing, the Court En Banc recently promulgated Guevarra-Castil v. Atty. Trinidad wherein it provided the following guidelines in the filing and handling of complaints against government lawyers:\n1. All complaints against and which seek to discipline government lawyers in their respective capacities as members of the Bar must be filed directly before this Court. Conversely, complaints which do not seek to discipline them as members of the Bar shall be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and referred to the Ombudsman or concerned government agency for appropriate action.\n2. In connection with paragraph 1, upon filing, the Court must determine whether the concerned agency, the Ombudsman, or the Court has jurisdiction over the complaint against the government lawyer. In making such determination, the following must be considered: did the allegations of malfeasance touch upon the errant lawyer's continuing obligations under the CPR and\/or the Lawyer's Oath? To put it more simply, the primordial question to be asked in making this determination is this: do the allegations in the complaint, assuming them to be true, make the lawyer unfit to practice the profession?\n2a. If the question in paragraph 2 yields a positive answer, the case properly lies before the Court, which shall retain jurisdiction. This is so because again, the power to regulate the practice of law, and discipline members of the bar, belongs to Us. Necessarily, proceedings to be had before this Court should concern these and only these matters. This rule shall hold, even if the complaint also contains allegations of administrative and\/or civil service rules infractions. In such situation however, the Court shall limit its ruling only to the matter of the respondent's fitness as a lawyer.\n2b. On the other hand, if the question in paragraph 2 yields a negative answer, the Court, for lack of jurisdiction, shall dismiss the case and refer the same to the appropriate government office or the Ombudsman.\n3. If multiple complaints have been filed, the process shall be the same. (Emphasis supplied)\nIn this case, a circumspect reading of the instant administrative disciplinary complaint readily shows that it seeks to discipline, i.e., disbar, respondent for acts committed in his capacity as a member of the Bar, particularly for his purported unauthorized practice of law. Following the Guevarra-Castil guidelines, it is only proper that the Court assume its jurisdiction over this case to determine whether respondent should indeed be held administratively liable for the aforesaid act.\nII.\nRepublic Act No. (RA) 6713, otherwise known as the \"Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees,\" particularly Section 7(b)(2), reads:\nSection 7. Prohibited Acts and Transactions.  In addition to acts and omissions of public officials and employees now prescribed in the Constitution and existing laws, the following shall constitute prohibited acts and transactions of any public official and employee and are hereby declared to be unlawful:\n. . . .\n(b) Outside employment and other activities related thereto. - Public officials and employees during their incumbency shall not:\n. . . .\n(2) Engage in the private practice of their profession unless authorized by the Constitution or law, provided, that such practice will not conflict or tend to conflict with their official functions[.]\nHere suffice it to say that since the records are bereft of proof that respondent possessed an authority to practice law outside of his duties as provincial legal officer, then his act of representing Degamo in the criminal and administrative cases against the latter constitute unauthorized practice of law.\nHowever, and in an attempt to exculpate himself from administrative liability, he contended in his answer that he believed his act of representing Degamo to be a performance of his official duties as provincial legal officer; and hence, not constituting private practice of law.\nSuch contention is untenable.\nFirst, jurisprudence holds that a basic conflict of interest exists when a government lawyer representing another public official before the Ombudsman. In Fajardo v. Atty. Alvarez, the respondent-lawyer, a Legal Officer III for the National Center for Mental Health, was charged, among others, with unauthorized practice of law when he represented a municipal treasurer in several cases before the Ombudsman. The respondent-lawyer therein argued that he had a valid authority to engage in private practice of the profession. Notwithstanding such authority, however, the Court, speaking through Senior Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen, found that he engaged in illicit practice of law, in violation of the Code, viz. :\nThere is basic conflict of interest here. Respondent is a public officer, an employee of government. The Office of the Ombudsman is part of government. By appearing against the Office of the Ombudsman, respondent is going against the same employer he swore to serve.\nIn addition, the government has a serious interest in the prosecution of erring employees and their corrupt acts. Under the Constitution, \"[p]ublic office is a public trust.\" The Office of the Ombudsman, as \"protectors of the [P]eople,\" is mandated to \"investigate and prosecute ...any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.\"\nThus, a conflict of interest exists when an incumbent government employee represents another government employee or public officer in a case pending before the Office of the Ombudsman. The incumbent officer ultimately goes against government's mandate under the Constitution to prosecute public officers or employees who have committed acts or omissions that appear to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient. further more, this is consistent with the constitutional directive that \"[p]ublic officers and employees must, at all times, be accountable to the [P]eople, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency; act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.\" (Emphasis supplied)\nAccordingly, the Court in Fajardo held the respondent-lawyer administratively liable for violating the following provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):\nCANON 1  A LAWYER SHALL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND PROMOTE RESPECT FOR LAW AND FOR LEGAL PROCESSES.\nRULE 1.. A lawyer, shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.\n. . . .\nCANON 7  A LAWYER SHALL AT ALL TIMES UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION, AND SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INTEGRATED BAR.\nSecond, respondent's insistence that it was part of his duties as provincial legal officer to represent the governor is patently erroneous. Section 481 (b) of the Local Government Code provides the following duties of the legal officer:\nSection 481. Qualifications, Term, Powers and Duties.  . . .\n(b) The legal officer, the chief legal counsel of the local government unit, shall take charge of the office of legal services and shall:\n(1) Formulate measures for the consideration of the sanggunian and provide legal assistance and support to the governor or mayor, as the case may be in carrying out the delivery of basic services and provisions of adequate facilities as provided for under Section 17 of this Code;\n(2) Develop plans and strategies and upon approval thereof by the governor or mayor, as the case may be, implement the same, particularly those which have to do with programs and projects related to legal services which the governor or mayor is empowered to implement and which the sanggunian is empowered to provide for under this Code.\n(3) In addition to the foregoing duties and functions, the legal officer shall:\n(i) Represent the local government unit in all civil actions and special proceedings wherein the local 249 government unit or any official thereof in his official capacity, is a party: Provided, That, in actions or proceedings where a component city or municipality is a party adverse to the provincial government or to another component city or municipality, a special legal officer may be employed to represent the adverse party;\n(ii) When required by the governor, mayor or sanggunian, draft ordinances, contracts, bonds, leases and other instruments, involving any interest of the local government unit and provide comments and recommendations on any instruments already drawn;\n(iii) Render his opinion in writing on any question of law when requested to do so by the governor, mayor, or sanggunian;\n(iv) Investigate or cause to be investigated any local official or employee for administrative neglect or misconduct in office, and recommend appropriate action to the governor, mayor or sanggunian, as the case may be;\n(v) Investigate or cause to be investigated any person, firm or corporation holding any franchise or exercising any public privilege for failure to comply with any term or condition in the grant of such franchise or privilege, and recommending appropriate action to the governor, mayor or sanggunian, as the case may be;\n(vi) When directed by the governor, mayor, or sanggunian, initiate and prosecute in the interest of the local government unit concerned any civil action on any bond, lease or other contract upon any breach or violation thereof; and\n(vii) Review and submit recommendations on ordinances approved and executive orders issued by component units\n(4) Recommend measures to the sanggunian and advise the governor or mayor as the case may be on all other matters related to upholding the rule of law;\n(5) Be in the frontline of protecting human rights and prosecuting any violations thereof particularly those which occur during and in the aftermath or man-made or natural disasters or calamities; and\n(6) Exercise such other powers and perform such other duties and functions as may be prescribed by law or ordinance.\nA reading of the foregoing provision shows that the functions of a legal officer relate to the official duties of officials of a local government unit, which are considered acts of the local government unit itselfan offshoot of the State agency doctrine which is a core concept in the law of public officers. From an administrative law perspective, \"public officers are considered as agents of the State and as such, acts done in the performance of their official functions are considered as acts of the State. In contrast, when a public officer acts negligently, or worse, in bad faith, the protective mantle of State immunity is lost as the officer is deemed to have acted outside the scope of his official functions; hence, be is treated to have acted in his personal capacity and necessarily, subject to liability on his own.\" In this regard, case law further instructs that the State authorizes only legal acts by its officers. Hence, acts by such officers which constitute a crime, or that are unauthorized and in excess of the powers given to them are not acts of the State; and consequently, the cloak of protection afforded to them is removed.\nHere, it is worthy to reiterate that respondent represented Degamo in a mix of administrative and criminal cases. In G.R. Nos. 226395, 228238, and 228325, Degamo was charged with several administrative offenses. In the cases that reached the Sandiganbayan, Degamo was criminally charged with, among others, Malversation of Public Funds and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. Respondent withdrew his appearance in the criminal case once he was directed to do so by the Sandiganbayan. This is similar, albeit not identical, to the facts in Fajardo, which also involved the representation by the errant lawyer of a public official in several administrative and criminal cases before the Ombudsman. As stated earlier, the Court noted that in cases before the Ombudsman, public officials are charged with \"acts or omissions that appear to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient.\" Verily, Degamo's alleged acts constituting those administrative offenses and crimes are no longer deemed as official acts of the local government unit which he serves; and as such, falls beyond the ambit of respondent's functions as provincial legal officer. Thus, respondent's act of representing Degamo in these cases constitutes unauthorized practice of law for which he should be held administratively liable, and accordingly sanctioned.\nNotably, a review of related jurisprudence shows that this is a case of first impression. In Urbano, the Court ruled that by virtue of an inherent conflict of interest, the Office of the Solicitor General may not represent an accused public official in any stage of a criminal case. In Fajardo, the errant lawyer is found liable for unauthorized practice of law when, as a legal officer for the National Center for Mental Health, he represented a public officer from another government agency in the latter's administrative and criminal cases before the Ombudsman.\nIn Cabalida v. Attys. Lobrido, Jr. and Pondevilla, the Court, through Chief Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro, averred that it was a city legal officer who was found liable for unauthorized practice of law when he, without proper authorization from his superior, represented a client in a civil case and acted as a partner in a law firm. Meanwhile, in Lorenzana v. Atty. Fajardo, the Court, through Associate Justice Angelina Sandoval-Gutierrez, stated that the lawyer maintained an extensive private legal practice without the permission of the Urban Resettlement Office in Manila, where he was employed at the time as its legal officer. Finally, in Catu v. Atty. Rellosa, the Court, through the late Chief Justice Renato Corona, declared that the lawyer, who concurrently served as punong barangay, was found guilty of unauthorized practice of law when he represented a client in an ejectment case without first securing the authorization of the Department of the Interior and Local Government.\nHere, the Court is presented with a situation where the legal officer of a LGU represented the chief executive of such unit in administrative and criminal cases before the Ombudsman, ostensibly in the performance of his duties as legal officer. The records do not indicate, and no allegation is made, that respondent engaged in private practice of law or that he failed to secure an authorization for private practice. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the conflict of interest discussed exhaustively in Fajardo is still present in this situation. A legal officer for an LGU encounters the same conflict of interest in representing the LGU's chief executive or any of its public officers in casesadministrative or criminalfiled before the Ombudsman. Thus, for the guidance of the Bench and the Bar, the Court emphasizes that legal officers of LG Us may not represent the public officials of the LG Us where they are serving in cases filed against such officials before the Ombudsman; it is a conflict of interest and amounts to unauthorized practice of law.\nIII.\nHaving established respondent's administrative liability, the Court now goes to the imposable penalty on him.\nPrevailing case law, specifically the cases earlier cited, instructs that the penalty imposed by the Court for similar transgressions is suspension from the practice of law ranging from six months to one year. In Fajardo, the Court suspended the respondent-lawyer for one year for appearing as defense counsel before the Ombudsman and for influence peddling. In Cabalida, the Court imposed an additional penalty of suspension for six months on Atty. Pondevilla in addition to his other offenses. The same penalty was imposed on the respondent-lawyer in the case of Lorenzana. Finally, in Catu, the Court imposed the same penalty on the respondent-lawyer. As in this case, the Court in Catu found that the lawyer violated Rule 1. of Canon 1 and Canon 7 of the CPR. Hence, the Court deems that a penalty of suspension from the practice of law for six months is proper.\nHowever, the Court sees the need for leniency in this case in light of respondent's honest belief that his acts were part of his duties and responsibilities as provincial legal officer. Instead, the Court finds that respondent must be reprimanded for his act of representing the Provincial Governor, which gave rise to a conflict of interest. The Court, however, stresses that the leniency of this penalty extends only to the present case and not to subsequent cases of legal officers representing their LGU's public officials when they are charged in their private capacities.\nACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Richard R. Enojo is found GUILTY of violating Rule 1., Canon 1, and Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

TOLEDO, THEN BRANCH CLERK OF COURT [NOW CLERK OF COURT V] AND MENCHIE BARCELONA, CLERK III, BOTH OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 259, PARAÑAQUE CITY, RESPONDENTS.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nGESMUNDO, C.J.:\nBefore the Court is a Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration Ad Cautelam filed by respondent Atty. Jerry R. Toledo ( Atty. Toledo ), seeking reconsideration of the Court's Per Curiam Decision dated February 4, 2020, finding him and his co-respondent, Menchie Barcelona ( Barcelona ) guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty, and imposing upon them the penalty of dismissal from the service, among others. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE , the Court finds respondents, Atty. Jerry R. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [now Clerk of Court V] and Menchie A. Barcelona, Clerk III, both of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 259, Parañaque City, GUILTY of Gross Neglect of Duty and are hereby DISMISSED from the service. Accordingly, their respective civil service eligibility are CANCELLED, and their retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, are hereby FORFEITED . Likewise, they are PERPETUALLY DISQUALIFIED from reemployment in any government agency or instrumentality, including government-owned and -controlled corporation or government financial institution.\nSO ORDERED.\nTo recall, the facts material to this case transpired when Atty. Toledo was the Branch Clerk of Court; while Barcelona was Clerk III of Branch 259, Regional Trial Court, Parañaque City ( Branch 259 ). Barcelona was the evidence custodian, who kept evidence submitted to the trial court in a steel cabinet; while Atty. Toledo, as branch clerk of court, was the immediate supervisor of Barcelona.\nIn November 2003, it was found out that 960. grams of shabu presented as evidence in Criminal Case No. 01-1229  a case for violation of Section 16, Article III of Republic Act ( R.A. ) No. 6425  was missing from Branch 259's steel cabinet. Further investigation revealed that 293. grams of shabu  evidence in Criminal Case No. 03-0408  was also missing from the steel cabinet where the evidence were kept. The disappearance of the subject evidence occurred while Barcelona was the evidence custodian; and while Atty. Toledo was the branch clerk of court.\nEventually, an administrative case was filed against Atty. Toledo and Barcelona (collectively, respondents ). After investigation, the Office of the Court Administrator ( OCA ) found that respondents should be held administratively guilty of simple neglect of duty. In line with this, the OCA recommended that Atty. Toledo be suspended for two months and one day without pay, while Barcelona be meted the penalty of one month and one day suspension without pay.\nLater, the Court issued its February 4, 2020 Decision, finding respondents guilty of the graver offense of Gross Neglect of Duty and imposing the ultimate penalty of dismissal from the service against them.\nAccordingly, Atty. Toledo filed his first Motion for Reconsideration (of the Decision dated February 4, 2020) and Barcelona filed a Motion for Reconsideration.\nIn a Resolution dated December 1, 2020, the court resolved to refer the motions for reconsideration to the OCA for evaluation, report, and recommendation. £A⩊phi£\nIn its Memorandum dated January 18, 2021, the OCA recommended that the motions for reconsideration be denied for lack of merit. It opined that the infractions committed by respondents may be considered simple neglect of duty only under ordinary circumstances. However, the OCA pointed out that the Court correctly adjudged respondents guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty given the nature and the volume of the missing evidence. It added that because of the incident, not only the criminal cases below were compromised, but the whole image of the Judiciary was tarnished as well. Finally, it claimed that no amount of mitigating circumstances can be appreciated in favor of respondents considering that more than one kilogram of shabu went missing under their watch.\nFollowing the said recommendation, the Court issued a Resolution dated February 16, 2021, which denied with finality the twin motions filed by respondents.\nDespite the denial of his first motion for reconsideration, Toledo subsequently filed a Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration Ad Cautelam assailing the February 4, 2020 Decision of the Court, essentially raising the following issues:\nI.\nWHETHER ATTY. TOLEDO COMMITTED GROSS NEGLECT OF DUTY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE.\nII.\nWHETHER THE PENALTY OF DISMISSAL FROM SERVICE SHOULD BE IMPOSED AGAINST ATTY. TOLEDO FOR GROSS NEGLECT OF DUTY.\nAtty. Toledo claims that he seasonably filed a motion for reconsideration against the February 4, 2020 Decision. However, he was already made to vacate his office as Clerk of Court V and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Office of the Clerk of Court. His former assistant clerk of court presently occupies his vacated position. Nevertheless, he still believes in the merit of his defense, and thus, he exhorts the Court to review his case once more.\nAccording to Atty. Toledo, he should not be declared guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty because there was neither a deliberate nor reckless failure on his part to discharge the functions of his position. What is more, he could not have prevented the pilferage, regardless of his assiduous performance of his duties.\nHe also argues that the lapses of Barcelona to immediately place the subject specimens inside the steel cabinet and their subsequent disappearance should not be attributed to his alleged failure to supervise the handling of physical evidence. He underscored that it is not humanly possible for him to see all the actions or inactions of his subordinates in their regular course of duties.\nFinally, Atty. Toledo averred that, even assuming that he is guilty of the offense of Gross Neglect of Duty, the extreme penalty of dismissal is not commensurate to the infraction he committed. He pleads that the Court appreciate the following mitigating circumstances in his favor: 1) his 24 long years of service in the Judiciary; 2) his employment record; and 3) his work ethics and dedication.\nThe Court's Ruling\nPreliminarily, it must be emphasized that the Court already issued a Resolution dated February 16, 2021, denying Atty. Toledo's first motion for reconsideration. Necessarily, the Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration Ad Cautelam filed by Atty. Toledo would be considered as a second motion for reconsideration assailing the February 4, 2020 Decision of the Court.\nAccording to Sec. 3, Rule 15 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court ( Internal Rules ), the Court shall not entertain a second motion for reconsideration, and any exception to this rule can only be granted in the higher interest of justice. There is reconsideration \"in the higher interest of justice\" when the assailed decision is not only legally erroneous, but is likewise patently unjust and potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties.\nA second motion for reconsideration, albeit prohibited, may be entertained in the higher interest of justice, such as when the assailed decision is not only legally erroneous, but also patently unjust and potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the moving party.\nIn a catena of cases, the Court has entertained and granted second motions for reconsideration \"in the higher interest of substantial justice,\" as allowed under the Internal Rules when the assailed decision is \"legally erroneous,\" \"patently unjust,\" and \"potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties.\" In Tirazona v. Philippine EDS Techno-Service, Inc., the Court likewise explained that a second motion for reconsideration may be allowed in instances of \"extraordinarily persuasive reasons and only after an express leave shall have first been obtained.\" In Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines, the Court allowed a second motion for reconsideration as the issue involved therein was a matter of public interest, as it pertained to the proper application of a basic constitutionally-guaranteed right in the government's implementation of its agrarian reform program. In San Miguel Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), the Court set aside the decisions of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC that favored claimants-security guards upon the Court's review of San Miguel Corporation's second motion for reconsideration. In Vir-Jen Shipping and Marine Services, Inc. v. NLRC, the Court En Banc reversed on a third motion for reconsideration the ruling of the Court's Division on therein private respondents' claim for wages and monetary benefits.\nIn Laya, Jr. v. Philippine Veterans Bank, the Court summarized that it may entertain second and subsequent motions for reconsideration when the assailed decision is legally erroneous, patently unjust, and potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties. Under these circumstances, even final and executory judgments may be set aside because of the existence of compelling reasons.\nIn this case, the Court finds that there is a higher interest of justice in entertaining the second motion for reconsideration filed by Atty. Toledo, considering that his sole employment, which is his family's livelihood and only means of support, is on the line. As will be discussed infra, the mitigating circumstances in favor of Atty. Toledo were not considered in the February 4, 2020 Decision and the February 16, 2021 Resolution of the Court. Thus, the Court deems it proper to resolve the second motion for reconsideration of Atty. Toledo on the merits.\nBefore proceeding further, it must be emphasized that, between respondents, only Atty. Toledo filed a second motion for reconsideration. Thus, the following discussions and ruling of the Court will only pertain to his administrative liability.\nAtty. Toledo must be made accountable for the loss of the subject evidence\nAfter scrutinizing the facts of this case once more the Court remains convinced that Atty. Toledo should be made accountable for the loss of the subject evidence, particularly, the 960. grams of shabu in Criminal Case No. 01-1229 and the 293. grams of shabu in Criminal Case No. 03-0408. As a branch clerk of court, Atty. Toledo had evident lapses because he failed to discharge his duties diligently. Indeed, he committed neglect of duty herein by failing to supervise Barcelona, who is the evidence custodian, in safekeeping the subject evidence, and give attention to a task expected of him.\nAs the Court pointed out in its Decision, the Revised Manual for Clerks of Court and the Rules of Court mandate that evidence turned over to the court shall be under the custody and safekeeping of the clerk of court. However, during the investigation, Atty. Toledo himself disclosed that he did not even know the contents of the steel cabinet and vault since he assumed office on October 22, 1996 because the previous branch clerk of court did not properly turn over the pieces of evidence stored in those receptacles to him. Moreover, since his appointment, he had given Barcelona a free hand to decide how to safeguard and inventory the evidence in custodia legis, insofar as criminal cases were concerned.\nIn line with this, the Court is not persuaded by Atty. Toledo's argument that he should not be made liable for the missing evidence, which was caused by Barcelona's negligence. While it may be sound for Atty. Toledo to argue that he should not be punished for the negligence of Barcelona, it must be emphasized that he is being held accountable for his own carelessness. He failed to supervise the safekeeping of court exhibits assiduously and to ensure that Barcelona diligently performed the task given to her.\nNotably, the Court cited the case of De la Victoria v. Cañete ( Cañete ) in the assailed February 4, 2020 Decision. In Cañete , the subordinate, an interpreter, was also in charge of the custody of court exhibits long before therein respondent branch clerk of court became appointed to the position. Moreover, the branch clerk of court in Cañete likewise failed to make an inventory of the existing Court exhibits upon his assumption and even during his tenure. Thus, as with the branch clerk of court in Cañete , Atty. Toledo cannot escape responsibility for the exhibits' loss, even though his subordinate was directly negligent in safekeeping the exhibits in question.\nOn the appropriate offense committed by Atty. Toledo under the circumstances\nAfter concluding Atty. Toledo's neglect of duty, the Court must necessarily reassess and reexamine whether his actuations and omissions amounted to simple neglect of duty, .or whether they transcended to gross neglect of duty.\nIt is well-settled that for a government employee to be guilty of gross neglect of duty, it must be shown that said employee manifested flagrant and culpable refusal or unwillingness to perform a duty. In contrast, simple neglect of duty means the failure of an employee or official to give proper attention to a task expected of him\/her, signifying a disregard of an obligation resulting from carelessness or indifference.\nIn this case, the Court still finds no reason to reverse its finding that Atty. Toledo is liable for gross neglect of duty. Again, substantial amounts of drug evidence were lost under Atty. Toledo's watch. While he was not the actual evidence custodian, he still had the duty to supervise Barcelona. In addition, although there was insufficient evidence to prove that the missing exhibits had some bearing on the results of the criminal cases where those exhibits were used, the fact that court exhibits were easily stolen from the court's custody taints the well-guarded image of the Judiciary and severely affects the trust of the people in this institution. Moreover, the loss of evidence indubitably endangered public welfare, as the stolen shabu could have gone into the hands of unscrupulous individuals.\nThe penalty imposable against Atty. Toledo should be modified in view of the mitigating circumstances of this case\nNevertheless, as to the imposable penalty, the Court deems it proper to modify the February 4, 2020 Decision in light of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, which was approved on February 22, 2022 and amended Rule 140 of the Rules of Court ( Rule 140 ). Rule 140, as amended, provides for a framework of administrative discipline that, among others, includes a list of administrative offenses with their own nomenclature, classification, and corresponding penalties, to govern administrative disciplinary cases against all Members (i.e., Justices and Judges), officials, employees, and personnel of the entire Judiciary. Sec. 24 thereof provides:\nSection 24. Retroactive Effect.  All the foregoing provisions shall be applied to all pending and future administrative cases involving the discipline of Members, officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary, without prejudice to the internal rules of the Committee on Ethics and Ethical Standards of the Supreme Court insofar as complaints against Members of the Supreme Court are concerned. (Emphasis supplied)\nAccordingly, when imposing the administrative penalty, the Court will no longer distinguish Members, officials, employees, and personnel of the Judiciary. Further, insofar as pending and future cases are concerned, the Court will not anymore distinguish whether the penalty imposed under this amended Rule would be prejudicial to the employee under the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (URACCS). It effectively abandons policy of distinction made in Dela Rama v. De Leon, regarding Rule 140 and the URACCS. Thus, Rule 140, as amended, will be applied uniformly to all pending and future administrative cases, which includes the case at bench.\nUnder Rule 140, as amended, gross neglect of duty in the performance or non-performance is classified as a serious charge. Sec. 17 of Rule 140, as amended, states the following sanctions for serious charge:\nSection 17. Sanctions. \n(1) If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:\n(a) Dismissal from service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Supreme Court may determine; and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations. Provided, however , that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;\n(b) Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six (6) months but not exceeding one (1) year; or\n(c) A fine of more than P100,000. but not exceeding P200,000..\nFurther, Rule 140, as amended, provides for mitigating circumstances, which may be considered by the Court in imposing a lesser penalty on respondent, to wit:\nSection 19. Modifying Circumstances.  In determining the appropriate penalty to be imposed, the Court may, in its discretion, appreciate the following mitigating and aggravating circumstances:\n(1) Mitigating circumstances:\n(a) First offense;\n(b) Length of service of at least ten (10) years with no previous disciplinary record where respondent was meted with an administrative penalty;\n(c) Exemplary performance;\n(d) Humanitarian considerations; and\n(e) Other analogous circumstances.\nx x x x\nSection 20. Manner of Imposition.  If one (1) or more aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances are present, the Supreme Court may impose the penalties of suspension or fine for a period or amount not exceeding double of the maximum prescribed under this Rule.\nIf one (1) or more mitigating circumstances and no aggravating circumstances are present, the Supreme Court may impose the penalties of suspension or fine for a period or amount not less than half of the minimum prescribed under this Rule.\nIf there are both aggravating and mitigating circumstances present, the Supreme Court may offset each other.\nBased on the foregoing, under Rule 140, as amended, if a mitigating circumstance exists, it may be appreciated by the Court in the determination of the imposition of the penalty against a respondent in the administrative case. Notably, the Court's February 4, 2020 Decision did not discuss any of the mitigating circumstances alleged by Atty. Toledo in the imposition of his penalty.\nIn Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Chavez, the Court cited instances where the imposition of penalties had been tempered due to the presence of mitigating circumstances, viz .:\nIn Judge Isidra A. Arganose-Maniego v. Rogelio T. Salinas, [the Court] suspended the respondent who was guilty of grave misconduct and dishonesty for a period of one (1) year without pay, taking into account the mitigating circumstances of: first offense, ten (10) years in government service, acknowledgment of infractions and reeling of remorse, and restitution of the amount involved.\nIn Alibsar Adoma v. Romeo Gatcheco and Eugenio Taguba, [the Court] suspended one of the respondents for one (1) year without pay, after finding him guilty of grave misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the service. The respondent was a first-time offender.\nAnd, in Horacio B. Apuyan, Jr. and Alexander O. Eugenio v. Alfredo G. Sta. Isabel, [the Court] imposed the same penalty of one (1)-year suspension without pay to the respondent who was a first-time offender of the offenses of grave misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interests of the service.\nAs regards judges, in Office of the Court Administrator v. Aguilar, [the Court] imposed the penalty of six months suspension instead of dismissal from service after taking into consideration. the mitigating circumstances of dismissal of related criminal cases for lack of probable cause, good faith, respondent judge's strong credentials for appointment as judge, length of government service, first time offense, and remorse and promise to be more accurate and circumspect in future submissions before [the Court].\nIn In Re: Petition for the Dismissal from Service and\/or Disbarment of Judge Baltazar R. Dizon, [the Court] reconsidered [its] earlier Decision dismissing from service the respondent judge and lowered the penalty to suspension from February 23, 1988 until the date of promulgation of the Resolution on May 31, 1989 after considering the mitigating circumstances of length of government service, lack of corrupt motives, environmental difficulties such as overloaded docket, unceasing strain caused by hearings on complex cases and lack of libraries, decent courtrooms, office equipment, supplies and other facilities, and humble repentance.\nIn Rubin v. Judge Corpus-Cabochan, [the Court] considered the mitigating circumstances of first offense in respondent judge's almost 23 years of government service, frail health, case load and candid admission of infraction in determining that the appropriate penalty to be imposed on respondent judge who was found guilty of gross inefficiency was admonition.\nIn Fernandez v. Vasquez, [the Court] appreciated the mitigating circumstances of unblemished judicial service and first offense in imposing the penalty of fine of [P50,000. against respondent judge who was held guilty of dishonesty, an offense punishable with dismissal even on the first commission. The fine was imposed in lieu of suspension from office which can no longer be imposed due to respondent judge's retirement.\nIn Perez v. Abiera, [the Court] imposed the penalty of fine equivalent to three-month salary of respondent judge, deductible from his retirement benefits, after appreciating the mitigating circumstances of length of service and poor health.\nThus, [the Court] exercise the discretion granted by the RRACCS and prevailing jurisprudence in the imposition of penalty and reconsider the dismissal and forfeiture of Judge Chavez's retirement benefits in view of mitigating circumstances that were overlooked and not properly appreciated.\n[The Court applies] to Judge Chavez the mitigating circumstances of: (1) remorse in committing the infractions; (2) length of government service; (3) first offense; and (4) health and age. These humanitarian considerations will mitigate Judge Chavez's penalty and remove him from the severe consequences of the penalty of dismissal and forfeiture of his retirement benefits. Taking into account these mitigating circumstances, together with the aggravating circumstance of being guilty of the lesser offense of undue delay in rendering decisions, [the Court] impose the penalty of fine equivalent to three months of Judge Chavez's last salary.\nTo reiterate, under Sec. 20 of Rule 140, as amended, when one or more mitigating circumstance and no aggravating circumstances are present, the Court may impose, in lieu of the dismissal from the service, the penalties of suspension or fine for a period or amount not less than half of the minimum prescribed under such Rule. On the other hand, if no mitigating circumstance exists, the Court will simply impose a specific penalty within the range provided by Rule 140, as amended, taking into consideration the relevant incidents surrounding the administrative offense.\nIn Judge Ladaga v. Atty. Salilin ( Salilin ), the Court imposed the penalty of dismissal against a branch clerk of court who similarly failed to diligently keep the drug evidence under custodia legis . Worthy to emphasize, however, that in Salilin, no mitigating circumstance existed which could have lowered the administrative penalty imposed against therein respondent.\nIn contrast, in Re: Report on the Preliminary Results of the Spot Audit in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 170, Malabon City ( Re: Report ), the Court found that there was sufficient evidence to hold therein respondent, Judge Docena, administratively liable for gross neglect of duty for the serious mismanagement of search warrant applications in Branch 170, and failing to properly monitor the submission of returns, and that 350 returns were filed late. Moreover, 43 returns were not immediately acted upon. The charge of gross neglect of duty is classified as a grave offense punishable by dismissal from the service.\nNevertheless, in Re: Report, the Court took into consideration the following circumstances in Judge Docena's favor, to wit: (1) his length of service of 30 years in various sectors of the government, with eight years spent rendering service in the Judiciary as a Technical Assistant in the Supreme Court and as an RTC Judge; (2) his candid admission of his lapses and his commitment to undertake stringent steps to address the matters brought to his attention by the OCA; and (3) the fact that it was Judge Docena's first time to be administratively sanctioned by the Court.\nInstead of imposing the penalty of dismissal, the Court imposed on Judge Docena the penalty of suspension from the office for two years without pay, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.\nIn this present case, the Court finds that there are several mitigating circumstances in favor of Atty. Toledo, particularly, (1) his more than 20 years of government service; (2) his lack of corrupt or bad motive; (3) being a first-time offender; and (4) his exemplary record.\nAs stated by Atty. Toledo, he has served the Judiciary for 24 years, starting in 1996 as Interpreter III until he eventually became a Clerk of Court V. This is the first time that he was held administratively liable by the Court. While a separate administrative complaint docketed as A.M. No. P-07-2403 was filed against him, said complaint was dismissed in the Court's Resolution in Re: Toledo v. Toledo. Indeed, this present case is his first and only administrative liability for an offense committed way back in 2003. The OCA does not dispute these facts.\nFurther, although Atty. Toledo committed gross neglect of duty in failing to properly supervise the evidence custodian of Branch 259, leading to the loss of substantial amounts of subject evidence, it is apparent that he did not commit the offense with ill, corrupt, or bad motive.\nThe steel cabinet, which should have contained the missing subject evidence, is located at the session room of Branch 259. On the other hand, the assigned room of Atty. Toledo is located outside the court premises, which he shares with the sheriff and the court interpreter. Due to the physical set-up, Atty. Toledo could not have effectively monitored the action or inaction made by the court staff, especially since the steel cabinet was inside the court session room. While this logistical situation does not excuse Atty. Toledo's gross neglect in the performance of his duties as clerk of court, it demonstrates that he does not have ill will or corrupt motive in the entire debacle regarding the disappearance of the subject evidence. He was just grossly negligent  plain and simple  without any bad or malicious intent on his part. Further, he readily recommended the conduct of an investigation regarding the missing subject evidence and cooperated thoroughly with the same. This fortifies the lack of ill motive on the part of Atty. Toledo. 1âшphi1\nAdditionally, the Court finds that under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the penalty to be imposed against Atty. Toledo should be mitigated on humanitarian considerations.\nAtty. Toledo is an unfortunate casualty of the circumstances. He definitely did not steal the subject evidence; rather, he was merely grossly remiss in the supervision of the evidence custodian. Dismissal is, indeed, too harsh a penalty to be imposed against him. He should not continuously be made the scapegoat and lose his means of livelihood in the process. It will be inequitable to nonchalantly impose upon Atty. Toledo the extreme penalty of dismissal, without due regard of the existing mitigating circumstances, while also turning a blind eye on the fact that the real culprit relishing the effects of his or her action since the theft transpired in 2003. This unfair situation is even more concerning considering that the thief could have also been a different court employee who remains comfortably under the Court's employ despite his or her reprehensible act.\nIn stark contrast, Atty. Toledo has been immensely miserable until now and will be made to suffer further if the Court does not consider the aforesaid mitigating circumstances in his favor. As Atty. Toledo pointed out in his Manifestation and Motion for Reconsideration Ad Cautelam, he was ordered to vacate his office as soon as the executive judge received a copy of the Court's Decision. He was stripped of his only means of income at the height of the pandemic in 2020 when there was dearth of similar income-generating activities available. For more than two years, he was out of job. He was forced to look for financial opportunities elsewhere to provide food for his family. He chose to dabble in selling food rather than find work as a lawyer because he did not want to give up on his fight to return to public service where he has devoted much of his years.\nIn its Memorandum, the OCA stated that no mitigating circumstance can be appreciated in favor of Atty. Toledo due to the gravity of the offense he committed. In short, the OCA claims that Atty. Toledo's acts are irredeemable. However, considering that there is no ill motive or bad faith on the part of Atty. Toledo and that he was not the perpetrator in the pilferage of court exhibits, it would be unjust and inequitable for the Court to completely turn a blind eye to the mitigating circumstances in his favor.\nIn light of the existence of several mitigating circumstances, for the offense of gross neglect of duty, the Court modifies the penalty of dismissal from the service imposed in the February 4, 2020 Decision to a penalty of suspension from office without pay for a period of two years and six months, in consideration of the gravity of the offense and in line with existing jurisprudence regarding mitigating circumstances.\nConsidering that he has been out of the service for two years and six months since the Court promulgated its February 4, 2020 Decision, which was immediately executory, his penalty of suspension for two years and six months is deemed served. Atty. Toledo must, thus, be reinstated to his former position.\nIn fine, it must be emphasized that in giving weight to the factual considerations in favor of Atty. Toledo, the Court does not abdicate its duty to render justice but merely sees to it that its ruling is not only correct but just. However, Atty. Toledo must take this opportunity to become a better court employee, who lives up to his avowed duties as a sentinel of justice. He should bear in mind that the Court will not hesitate to punish him more severely for any subsequent infraction. Whenever there is an exercise of compassion in imposing administrative penalties, the Court emphatically holds all concerned court employees to their respective promises that they will not commit the same infraction, or else they will be at the end of the mailed fists of the Court. Such compassion, which is not limitless but discriminating, should not be taken for granted.\nWHEREFORE , the second motion for reconsideration is PARTIALLY GRANTED . The Decision dated February 4, 2020 and the Resolution dated February 16, 2021 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that respondent Atty. Jerry R. Toledo is found GUILTY of Gross Neglect of Duty and meted the penalty of SUSPENSION from the office without pay, for a period of two (2) years and six (6) months. He is also STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same offense or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.\nConsidering that the modified penalty is now DEEMED SERVED by Atty. Toledo, he is REINSTATED to his former position.\nSO ORDERED.\nLeonen, SAJ., Caguioa, Hernando, Lazaro-Javier, Inting, Zalameda, M. Lopez, Gaerlan, Rosario, J.

{"id":6032,"text":"Manila\nSECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 261049, June 26, 2023 ]\nXXX261049, 1 PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nLOPEZ, M., J.:\nThere is no requirement in our criminal law that only direct evidence may convict. 2 \"The identity of the perpetrator and the finding of guilt may rely solely on the strength of circumstantial evidence.\" 3 Circumstantial evidence sufficient for conviction is like a tapestry made up of interwoven strands that create a pattern. Each strand cannot be plucked out and appreciated separately because it only forms part of the whole picture. 4\nThis resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari 5 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision 6 dated June 25, 2021 and Resolution 7 dated May 16, 2022 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 43881. The challenged CA issuances affirmed the Joint Decision 8 dated February 8, 2019 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of ███████, Branch ██, convicting petitioner XXX261049 of the offense under Section 4(a) 9 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9995 10 or the \"Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009.\"\nFacts\nIn four criminal cases, XXX261049 was charged with violation of Section 4(a) of RA No. 9995 as follows:\nCRIMINAL CASE NO. 18882\n\"That on or about [the] 11th day of October 2016, in the █████████████, 11 Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously take a video coverage of one [AAA261049,] 12 while the latter was taking a bath and capture [sic] the private area of the latter such as naked or undergarment clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks or female breast, without consent of said [AAA261049] and while the latter has reasonable expectation of privacy, in violation of the above-cited law.\nContrary to law.\" 13\nThe other Informations 14 were similarly worded except for the names of the offended parties, viz. : (1) Criminal Case No. 18883  BBB261049 15 ; (2) Criminal Case No. 18884  CCC261049 16 ; and (3) Criminal Case No. 18885  DDD261049 17 .\nThe prosecution presented the testimonies of AAA261049, BBB261049, DDD261049, CCC261049, and Richard Castillo (Richard). These testimonies established that AAA261049, BBB261049, and DDD261049 are sisters, while CCC261049 is their cousin. They all lived in the same house. XXX261049 is their uncle, who frequented their house as he was tasked to supervise the ongoing renovation at that time. Richard, on the other hand, was one of the four construction workers working on the house renovation. 18\nAAA261049 testified that on October 11, 2016, she was preparing hot water in the kitchen for her bath when she saw her uncle enter the bathroom. After about five minutes, XXX261049 came out, prompting AAA261049 to get her hot water and take her turn in the bathroom. As she was preparing, she noticed a tiny light shining through a small hole in a Safeguard soap box on top of the shelf. Upon checking what was inside the soap box, she saw a Blackberry cellular phone with the video on for around nine minutes already. She immediately recognized the phone as XXX261049's. The phone was placed inside the box in such a way that its camera was able to capture whatever was happening in the bath area. Scared but curious, AAA261049 checked the recording and saw XXX261049 in the act of setting up the phone in the bathroom at the beginning of the video. Shocked at her discovery, she hastily deleted the video. However, still concerned of what other videos were contained in the phone and realizing that she needed evidence, she browsed further through the phone's contents and saw several nude videos, not only of herself, but also those of BBB261049, DDD261049, and CCC261049, while taking a bath in the same area. With quick thinking this time, before she deleted the videos from XXX261049 's phone, AAA261049 hurriedly stepped out of the bathroom to get her own phone and, thereafter, came back to capture snippets and stills of the malicious videos from XXX261049's phone. Unfortunately, as she was rushing, AAA261049 was not able to capture a video or photo with DDD261049 in it. Afterwards, she returned the phone in the soap box in the same way that she found it and then locked herself in her room, frightened of what her uncle might do when he finds out that the videos on his phone were discovered and deleted. 19\nAfter a while, AAA261049 heard XXX261049 calling for her to tell her that her aunt was there to see her. AAA261049 did not open the door until she heard her aunt's voice. AAA261049 then immediately locked the door after her aunt stepped in. She told her aunt about her discovery and showed her the photos that she took from her uncle's phone. Shocked as well, the aunt took AAA261049 with her to her house where they called AAA261049's mother to tell her about AAA261049's discovery. Not long later, AAA261049's mother arrived at their aunt's house and saw the nude snippets that AAA261049 captured from the videos on XXX261049's phone. Thereafter, AAA261049 and her mother went back to their house and informed BBB261049, DDD261049, and CCC261049 of what happened. They confronted XXX261049, who merely denied the allegations and offered to leave his phone with them for inspection. But XXX261049 was told that leaving his phone was unnecessary since AAA261049 had already copied parts and then deleted all the scandalous videos in it, prompting XXX261049 to just leave. ℒαwρhi৷ They then copied the nude stills from AAA261049's phone to a DVD-R and made printed copies for evidentiary purposes. The next day, they reported the incident to the barangay. 20\nBBB261049, DDD261049, and CCC261049 corroborated AAA261049's testimony. They all testified that they saw the nude stills that AAA261049 captured from the videos on XXX261049's phone. Richard, on the other hand, confirmed that he and his other co-workers had no access to the bathroom inside the house. All the witnesses were certain that the subject phone was XXX261049's as he was the only one in that household with that type of phone and everyone sees him using it frequently. 21\nAside from the foregoing testimonial evidence, the prosecution also presented printed copies of the naked images taken by AAA261049 from XXX261049's phone, the DVD-R where they burned a copy of the scandalous materials, and the Safeguard soap box. 22\nXXX261049 testified for his defense, denying the accusations against him. He claimed that he had a similar type of phone, which he allegedly lost three months before the incident. He averred that his nieces concocted a story about him because they did not like him around as he always chides them when they come home late and refuse to help with the household chores. 23\nAfter trial, the RTC rendered the Joint Decision 24 dated February 8, 2019. In Criminal Case Nos. 18882, 18883, and 18884, the RTC found the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, which were corroborated by the authenticated video and photos submitted in evidence, credible and sufficient to support a conviction for the violation of Section 4(a) of RA No. 9995. However, in Criminal Case No. 18885, the RTC found insufficient evidence to convict XXX261049 since no photo or video of DDD261049 was presented. The RTC disposed, thus:\nWHEREFORE, x x x, judgment is rendered as follows:\n1. In Criminal Case No. 18882, this court finds accused [XXX261049 , GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 4(a) of RA [No.] 9995 x x x and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of four (4) years, six (6) months and one (1) day as minimum to six (6) years, ten (10) months and one (1) day as maximum and a fine of [PHP] 300,000.. He is hereby ordered to pay [AAA261049] the amounts of [PHP] 50,000. as moral damages, [PHP] 30,000. as exemplary damages[,] and [PHP] 50,000. as attorney's fees.\n2. In Criminal Case No. 18883, this Court finds accused [XXX261049 , GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 4(a) of RA [No.] 9995 x x x and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of four (4) years, six (6) months and one (1) day as minimum to six (6) years, ten (10) months and one (1) day as maximum and a fine of [PHP] 300,000.. He is hereby ordered to pay [BBB261049] the amounts of [PHP] 50,000. as moral damages, [PHP] 30,000. as exemplary damages[,] and [PHP] 50,000. as attorney's fees.\n3. In Criminal Case No. 18884, this Court finds accused [XXX261049], GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 4(a) of RA [No.] 9995 x x x and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of four (4) years, six (6) months and one (1) day as minimum to six (6) years, ten (10) months and one (1) day as maximum and a fine of [PHP] 300,000.. He is hereby ordered to pay [CCC261049] the amounts of [PHP] 50,000. as moral damages, [PHP] 30,000. as exemplary damages[,] and [PHP] 50,000. as attorney's fees.\n4. In Criminal Case No. 18885, for insufficiency of evidence, accused [XXX261049] is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime of Violation of Section 4(a) of RA [No.] 9995 x x x.\nA legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) [ per annum ] shall be imposed on all the monetary awards for damages from the date of the finality of this judgment until fully paid.\nSO ORDERED. 25\nOn appeal, the CA affirmed the RTC Joint Decision in its entirety and disposed as follows:\nWHEREFORE, x x x, the appeal is DENIED and the Decision dated February 8, 2019 of the [RTC] in Criminal Cases Nos. 18882-85 is hereby AFFIRMED .\nSO ORDERED. 26\nXXX261049's motion for reconsideration was likewise denied in the assailed CA Resolution 27 dated May 16, 2022 as follows:\nWHEREFORE, there being no substantial argument which would warrant the modification much less the reversal of this Court's June 25, 2021 Decision, [XXX261049] Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.\nSO ORDERED. 28\nHence, this Petition. XXX261049 reiterates his acquittal since the pieces of evidence against him are entirely circumstantial and, as such, insufficient to justify his conviction. He argues that each circumstance relied upon by the courts a quo was solely hinged upon the incredible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. XXX261049 inveighs that his presence at the victims' house on the day of the incident does not identify him as the perpetrator as four construction workers were also present at the place. 29 Also, the single instance that AAA261049 saw him entering the bathroom before the discovery was not sufficient to single him out as the assailant. 30 XXX261049 further highlights that there was no proof to corroborate AAA261049's claim that she saw XXX261049 in one of the videos, setting up the phone in the bathroom. For XXX261049, it is unbelievable that AAA261049 simply deleted such strong evidence without capturing a video or photo of it for evidentiary purposes as she had done with the other videos. 31 Moreover, aside from the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, no incontrovertible proof was presented to establish that he owns the phone wherein videos of his naked nieces were found. 32 Finally, XXX261049 reckons it foolish for him to enter the bathroom and set up the phone while AAA261049 was just nearby only to make the alleged devious deed obvious. 33 Hence, XXX261049 maintains that there was no moral certainty that he was guilty of the charges. 34\nIssue\nWas XXX261049's guilt for the violation of Section 4(a) of RA No. 9995 proven beyond reasonable doubt?\nRuling\nWe answer in the affirmative.\nArticle 26 35 of the Civil Code adjures every person to \"respect the dignity, personality, privacy, and peace of mind\" of one another. The provision further states that acts contrary to such directive \"shall produce a cause of action for damages, prevention, and other relief.\" Verily, grounded upon the State policy of \"valuing the dignity and privacy of every human person and guaranteeing full respect for human rights,\" 36 Section 4(a) of RA No. 9995 provides:\nSEC. 4. Prohibited Acts.  It is hereby prohibited and declared unlawful for any person:\n(a) To take photo or video coverage of a person or group of persons performing sexual act or any similar activity or to capture an image of the private area of a person\/s such as the naked or undergarment clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks or female breast without the consent of the person\/s involved and under circumstances in which the person\/s has\/have a reasonable expectation of privacy[.] (Emphasis supplied)\nParsed from this provision, \"photo or video voyeurism\" is committed when:\n1. The accused takes a photo or video coverage of a person or group of persons performing sexual act or any similar activity or captures an image of the private area of a person or persons such as the naked or undergarment-clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks or female breast;\n2. The photo or video was taken without the consent of the person\/s involved; and\n3. The photo or video was taken under circumstances in which the person\/s has\/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nWe affirm the uniform findings of the RTC and the CA on the existence of all these elements.\nFirst, it is undisputed that videos of AAA261049, BBB261049, and CCC261049 while taking a bath naked were captured through a built-in video recorder in a Blackberry phone. This was shown by the stills captured by AAA261049 from the Blackberry phone which were presented and admitted in evidence without objection. That the Blackberry phone was XXX261049's and that it was he who took the videos were proven by the convergent testimonies of the prosecution witnesses that: (1) only XXX261049 has that type of phone in that household and that they frequently see him using it; (2) XXX261049 was at the victims' house and used the bathroom for five minutes right before AAA261049's turn to use the same bathroom; (3) AAA261049 proceeded to use the bathroom immediately after XXX261049 stepped out and, while preparing to bathe, she saw the phone video rolling for about nine minutes already, coinciding with the number of minutes that it took XXX261049 to set up the phone and the time when AAA261049 discovered it; (4) the construction workers had no access to the floor where the bathroom was located; 37 and, more tellingly, (5) the first video that AAA261049 saw from the phone showed XXX261049 in the act of setting up the video in the bathroom. 38 During cross-examination, AAA261049 unwaveringly testified as follows:\nATTY. GRANDE:\nQ: You testified in your Judicial Affidavit that the said phone was allegedly owned by [XXX261049] am I correct?\nA: Yes, sir.\nQ: Other than your statements, do you have any proof which you could say that the alleged [ Blackberry ] phone was indeed owned by [XXX261049?]\nA: I know that it is his phone, sir, because he is staying in our house for almost two (2) years and he is using it every time, sir.\nQ: So, your only proof is your word that that [ sic ] phone is his phone?\nA: All of my family members knew that it is his phone, sir. There is no other member in the family owns [ sic ] a [ Blackberry ] phone, so we know that it is his phone.\nQ: You testified in your Judicial [A]ffidavit that your house was at that time being renovated?\nA: Yes, sir.\nQ: Would it be possible that the phone is owned by other individual who were laborers, who were renovating or fixing your house?\nA: There is no possibility because they don't have access in our bathroom and they are staying in the second floor, the laborers, sir.\nCOURT:\nOne moment.\nQ: By the way, where is that [ Blackberry ] phone?\nA: We don't have it, your honor.\nQ: You were not able to confiscate it at that time?\nA: No, your honor.\nQ: So, even the contents you did not know about it, the contents of the alleged video, if any?\nA: I browsed it and I took pictures, your Honor.\nQ: So, that's the only thing that you did. You did not confiscate the phone?\nA: No, your Honor, because we were alone at home, I was so scared; I just thought we need evidence.\nCOURT:\nContinue.\nATTY. GRANDE:\nQ: In your Judicial [A]ffidavit[,] you again said that you saw accused in one (1) of the videos setting up?\nA: Yes, sir.\nQ: Do you have a photo of the scene wherein he was the one setting up the video?\nA: For that video, sir, I don't have video of that because at that time when I saw him setting it up inside, I was so scared with [ sic ] his face.\nATTY. ARMOVIT:\nMay we manifest, your Honor, that the witness is crying while testifying.\nATTY. GRANDE:\nQ: So, what happened with the video again?\nA: I deleted as I saw him setting it up inside the bathroom, sir.\nQ: How about the other videos?\nA: I was scared about the videos because I know he can do such thing, so I browsed it then I saw the next videos of us and I played it and saw everything, sir. 39\nContrary to XXX261049's insistence, AAA261049's failure to make a copy of the video which showed XXX261049's face does not undermine the credibility of her testimony. As gleaned from AAA261049's testimony, she was shocked and scared when she saw her uncle's face in the video, which prompted her to delete it at once without thinking of securing evidence. Her reaction cannot be taken against her:\nx x x It is settled that there could be \"no hard and fast gauge [to measure one's] reaction or behavior when confronted with a startling, not to mention horrifying, occurrence x x x. Witnesses[, more so victims,] of startling occurrences react differently depending upon their situation and state of mind, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience. The workings [sic] of the human mind placed under emotional stress are unpredictable, and people react differently to shocking stimulus  some may shout, some may faint, and others may be plunged into insensibility. 40\nIn any case, we have consistently deferred to the trial court's factual findings and assessment on the credibility of witnesses in the absence of any clear showing that material facts or considerations were overlooked or misconstrued. This is because of the trial court's unique position to observe the demeanor of witnesses, their conduct and attitude under grilling examination, and to appreciate their truthfulness, honesty, and candor first­-hand. 41 This holds especially true when the trial court's findings were affirmed by the CA as in this case.\nAlso, the lack of ill motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses further strengthens their credibility. Jurisprudence tells us that witnesses were not ill-motivated in testifying when there is no evidence of such ill or improper motive. (awÞhi( Here, the Court finds XXX261049's unfounded allegation, not only flimsy but scarcely credible, that the charges were stirred by the offended parties' feeling of dislike towards their uncle because of being reprimanded for coming home late and refusing to help with the household chores. Truth be told, it is highly improbable that decent and professional women such as AAA261049 (a nurse), BBB261049 (an accountant), DDD261049 (a senior software engineer), and CCC261049 (a content editor) would concoct a sordid story and ridicule themselves and their family's reputation on public trial simply because they did not like their uncle's reproach. 42\nVerily, there is moral certainty that XXX261049 captured naked images of AAA261049, BBB261049, DDD261049, and CCC261049 through his phone. The above-enumerated circumstances were proven beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution evidence; and such proven collateral facts, taken together, provided an unbroken chain leading to the fair conclusion that XXX261049 perpetrated the offense charged. Indeed, there is no requirement in our criminal law that only direct evidence may convict. \"The identity of the perpetrator and the finding of guilt may rely solely on the strength of circumstantial evidence, 43 which should be scrutinized \"like a tapestry made up of interwoven strands which create a pattern;\" each strand cannot be plucked out and appreciated separately because it only forms part of the whole picture. 44 This is consistent with Rule 133, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, which ordains the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence for conviction when: (1) there is more than one circumstance; (2) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (3) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. 45\nAnent the second element, there is no question that the malicious videos were taken without the consent of the victims because it was intentionally done in an unobtrusive manner, i.e., through a phone hidden in a soap box.\nAs to the last element, needless to say, the videos were discreetly taken in a bathroom, i.e., under \"circumstances in which a reasonable person would believe that he\/she could disrobe in privacy, without being concerned that an image or a private area of the person was being captured or circumstances in which a reasonable person would believe that a private area of the person would not be visible to the public, regardless of whether that person is in a public or private place.\" 46\nXXX261049's unsupported denial finds no chance to prevail over the positive and credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, which were corroborated by the other evidence on record. Denial is an inherently weak and self-serving defense, bereft of weight in the courts of law when uncorroborated by any other competent evidence. 47\nTherefore, the Court finds no cogent reason to reverse the conviction.\nThe indeterminate penalty of imprisonment for four years, six months, and one day to six years, 10 months, and one day plus fine of PHP 300,000. for each case is likewise affirmed in accord with RA No. 9995, Section 5. 48\nAs well, we affirm the award of moral and exemplary damages. Moral damages may be recovered in a criminal offense to compensate for the mental anguish, serious anxiety, and moral shock suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offender's wrongful act. 49 To be sure, XXX261049's pervert act of voyeurism caused \"distress, humiliation, or mental anguish\" 50 to his nieces. Exemplary damages, on the other hand, are imposed by way of correction for the public good. 51 Such corrective damages serve \"as a deterrent to serious wrongdoings, and as a vindication of undue suffering and wanton invasion of the rights of an injured or a punishment for those guilty of outrageous conduct\" 52 such as taking pleasure in watching unsuspecting victims who are naked while doing private acts in the bathroom.\nThe Court, however, finds it proper to modify the amounts of damages in accordance with the prevailing jurisprudence. In People v. Tulagan, 53 the Court fixed the amounts of moral damages and exemplary damages to PHP 50,000., taking into account that the imposable penalties for the crimes involved are within the range of reclusion temporal. 54 In People v. Jugueta, 55 moral damages were set to PHP 50,000. for crimes that result in the death of the victim, PHP 30,000. when such crimes were committed on a frustrated stage, and PHP 20,000. when merely attempted. Further in Jugueta, moral and exemplary damages were pegged at PHP 50,000. for special complex crimes which resulted in victims suffering mortal or fatal wounds; and PHP 25,000. when the victims suffered non-mortal or non­fatal wounds. In the recent case of Carbonell v. People, 56 which involved a lascivious conduct conviction under RA No. 7610, moral damages and exemplary damages were awarded in the amount of PHP 15,000.. Here, without trivializing the ripples of photo or video voyeurism to the victims, it is noteworthy that the offense docs not result in death or physical injuries. Too, its imposable penalty is lower than reclusion temporal. Considering, as well, the surrounding circumstances of this case, the Court finds it apt to reduce the moral damages from PHP 50,000. to PHP 15,000., and the exemplary damages from PHP 30,000. to PHP 15,000..\nThe Court, moreover, deletes the attorney's fees awarded as the RTC and CA decisions had nil discussion on the grant of attorney's fees. Neither was there anything on record that proves private complainants' incurrence of such expense. 57 It must be remembered that, under Article 2208 of the Civil Code, \"award of attorney's fees is the exception rather than the general rule, [as such,] it is necessary for the court to make findings of facts and law that would bring the case within the exception and justify [its grant].\" 58 The factual, legal, or equitable justification for the grant of attorney's fees \"must be stated in the text of the court's decision; otherwise if it is stated only in the dispositive portion [as in this case,] the same must be disallowed on appeal\" 59 even when exemplary damages were awarded. 60\nFinally, in conformity with current policy, the interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum is imposed on all the monetary awards from the finality of this judgment until full satisfaction.\nACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED . The Decision dated June 25, 2021 and Resolution dated May 16, 2022 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 43881, which affirmed the Joint Decision dated February 8, 2019 of the Regional Trial Court of ███████ Rizal, Branch xx, convicting petitioner XXX261049 of violation of Section 4(a) of Republic Act No. 9995 or the \"Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009, are AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS:\n1.

{"id":6033,"text":"Baguio City\nEN BANC\n[ A.C. No. 9683, April 18, 2023 ]\nCOURT OF APPEALS ASSOCIATE JUSTICE APOLINARIO D. BRUSELAS, JR., COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ELIGIO P. MALLARI, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nPER CURIAM:\nThis concerns a Privileged Communication dated November 12, 2012, sent to this Court by Associate Justice Apolinario D. Bruselas, Jr. (Justice Bruselas) of the Court of Appeals (CA), which was docketed as a regular administrative complaint.\nAttached to the Privileged Communication are the photocopied clippings of an advertisement published in two national newspapers, by which Atty. Eligio P. Mallari (Atty. Mallari) challenged Justice Bruselas to a televised public debate on the topic \"The Court of Appeals SPECIAL FOURTH DIVISION OF FIVE AMENDED DECISION, dated [February 24, 2011], in CA-GR.SP. No. 106838, penned by Justice Apolinario D. Bruselas, Jr. is VOID.\" Said Amended Decision arose from a consignation case filed by Atty. Mallari against Philippine National Bank (PNB), in order to implement a Deed of Promise to Sell over certain lots located in San Fernando, Pampanga. In brief, the Amended Decision reinstated PNB's notice of appeal of the trial court's decision in the consignation case, which ordered PNB to accept the payment tendered by Atty. Mallari for the lots subject of Civil Case No. Q-06-58366.\nThrough a Resolution dated June 10, 2014, this Court directed Atty. Mallari to comment on the aforementioned advertisement, and to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility. On February 14, 2017, the present complaint was consolidated with IPI Nos. 17-250-CA-J to J7-255-CA-J, which are the administrative complaints filed by Atty. Mallari against Justice Bruselas and five other justices of the CA, for rendering the Amended Decision in CA-G.R. SP. No. 106838.\nIn its Resolution dated February 21, 2017, this Court dismissed the complaints filed by Atty. Mallari against Justice Bruselas and the five other CA Associate Justices, on the ground that Atty. Mallari utterly failed to substantiate the allegations he hurled against them; thus:\nAt least in Umali there were accusations, albeit also unsubstantiated, of extortion and manifest partiality. In the present case, there was none at all. Atty. Mallari merely insists that the rulings of respondent Justices were wrong.\n. . . .\n. . . Atty. Mallari does not even allege that respondent Justices were motivated by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty, or corruption in rendering the judgments. What he alleges is that they did so for reasons known only to them. To demonstrate, the allegations read:\nFor VIOLATION of the provision of Sec. 7 (sub paragraph c), Rule VI, 2009 Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, when instead of referring back PNB's Motion for Reconsideration of the CA Decision dated August 11, 2009 of [sic] to the CA FOURTH DIVISION, he PARTICIPATED and C[O]NCURRED with the promulgation of the CA \"VOID\" Amended Decision dated February 24, 2011 for reasons KNOWN ONLY TO HIM.\n. . . .\nFor VIOLATION of the provision under Section 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court which provides the mandatory period of 60 days prescriptive period within which to file Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 WHEN HE DID NOT SEE OR DID NOT LOOK into the matter that the PNB's Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court in CA-GR SP No, 106838 is LONG PRESCRIBED Petition for Certiorari for reasons KNOWN ONLY TO HIM. (Emphases and underscoring in the original)\nSpecifically, with regard to respondent Justice Reyes, he allegedly disregarded plaintiffs' pleas for the reversion to the CA Fourth Division of PNB's Motion for Reconsideration \"for reasons known only to him.\"\nAnother ground for the dismissal of these complaints is the existence of judicial remedies. In Rodriguez v. Gatdula, this Court held that administrative complaints against judges cannot be pursued simultaneously with judicial remedies available to persons aggrieved by the erroneous orders or judgments. Further, \"it is only after the available judicial remedies have been exhausted and the appellate tribunals have spoken with finality, that the door to an inquiry into his criminal, civil, or administrative liability may be said to have opened, or closed.\"\nIt is clear and undisputed that the assailed rulings were issued in the exercise of respondents\" judicial functions. In the Amended Decision, respondent Justices explained that they reconsidered their earlier Decision, because they were constrained by policy considerations to prioritize substance over procedural niceties. Assuming that respondent Justices erred in their judgment, Atty. Mallari still failed to establish that any of them was moved by fraud, dishonesty, malice, corrupt motive, improper considerations, or deliberate intent to do an injustice.\nOn the charge of gross dishonesty\nNo factual details have been provided to substantiate this charge. Atty. Mallari merely quotes a definition of \"gross dishonesty\" from jurisprudence. 1aшphi1\n. . . .\nWe observe that the time element in the filing of these complaints is highly suspect, considering that the allegedly \"void\" Amended Decision was rendered way back in 2011, while these Verified Complaints were filed only on 5 December 2016, or three days after the Judicial and Bar Council had released the names of the nominees for the position of Associate Justice of this Court (vice Justice Jose P. Perez). The list included Justices Bruselas, Dimaampao, and Reyes. It was also publicly made known that Justice Tijam had applied for the position, and that he had been nominated for the position of Associate Justice (vice Justice Arturo D. Brion).\nThe Clerk of Court also reported that the following administrative cases have been filed by Atty. Mallari against the very same respondent Justices:\n1) A.M. OCA IPI No. 11-182-CA-J ( Atty. Eligio P. Mallari v. Court of Appeals Justice Apolinario D. Bruselas, Jr., Division Clerk of Court Josefina C. Mallari, and Atty. Antonio M. Elicaño )  DISMISSED for prematurity and lack of merit in a Resolution dated 29 November 2011\n2) A.M. OCA IPI No. 12-195-CA-J ( Re: Complaint of Atty. Eligio P. Mallari against Court of Appeals Justices Rebecca de Guia-Salvador and Apolinario D. Bruselas, Jr. ) - DISMISSED for lack of showing of prima facie case in a Resolution dated 10 August 2012\n3) IPI No. 13-211-CA-J ( Re: Complaint of Atty. Eligio P. Mallari against Court of Appeals Presiding Justice Andres B. Reyes, Jr. and Associate Justices Socorro B. Inting, Noel G. Tijam, Agnes R. Carpio, and Edwin Sorongon relative to CA-GR SP No. 106838 )  DISMISSED for lack of showing of prima facie case in a Resolution dated 10 June 2013.\nIt appears that those administrative cases were filed in connection with respondent Justices' ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 106838.\nThe Court Administrator likewise reported that complaints filed by Atty. Mallari against two RTC judges in San Fernando, Pampanga, and another complaint against an RTC judge in Quezon City were dismissed for utter lack of merit and\/or for being judicial in nature. At present, complaints filed by Atty. Mallari against five other RTC judges in the same cities are pending before the Court.\nThe same Resolution also directed Atty. Mallari to: 1) show cause why he should not be held for contempt for non-compliance with the June 10, 2014 Resolution; 2) show cause why he should not be sanctioned for violation of the Lawyers' Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility for filing unfounded administrative complaints; and 3) comply with the June 10, 2014 Resolution.\nAfter a long delay occasioned by difficulties in serving the June 10, 2014 Resolution on Atty. Mallari, the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) received on March 27, 2017 a pleading, which hereinafter will be referred to as the March 2017 Compliance, with the following caption:\nI. MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE EN BANC RESOLUTION DATED FEBRUARY 21, 2017 IN IPI No. 17-250-CA-J, IPI No. 17-251-CA-J, IPI No. 17-252-CA-J, IPI No. 17-253-CA-J, IPI No. 17-254-CA-J; AND IPI No. 17-255-CA-J\nII. COMPLIANCE TO SHOW CAUSE WHY COMPLAINANT ATTY. ELIGIO P. MALLARI SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTRATIVELY SANCTIONED FOR FILING UNFOUNDED SUITS IN VIOLATION OF THE LAWYER'S OATH AND THE CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY;\nIII. COMPLIANCE TO SHOW CAUSE WHY ATTY. ELIGIO P. MALLARI SHOULD NOT BE HELD IN CONTEMPT FOR HIS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE RESOLUTION DATED 10 JUNE 2014 IN A.C. NO. 9683; AND\nIV. ATTY. ELIGIO P. MALLARIs COMPLIANCE OF THE RESOLUTION DATED 10 JUNE 2014.\nIn this March 2017 Compliance, Atty. Mallari argues that the bases for his administrative complaints against the concerned CA justices are discernible from the RTC's rulings and orders, as well as the original CA decision dated August 11, 2009. He maintains that these decisions and orders show that PNB's notice of appeal and petition for certiorari against the RTC's ruling in the consignation case were filed out of time; and therefore the reinstatement of PNB's appeal by the concerned CA justices constitutes \"clear and convincing evidence\" of gross misconduct. Atty. Mallari openly admits that he challenged, not only Justice Bruselas, but also the eight other CA justices who participated in the adjudication of CA-G.R. SP No. 106838, to a public debate. He argues that the debate challenge was an honest, bona fide move to uphold the rule of law and cleanse the judiciary of misfits, which he resorted to after the dismissal of his administrative complaints against the CA justices who ruled against him.\nOn October 10, 2017, this Court issued a Resolution denying Atty. Mallari's motion for reconsideration in IPI Nos. 17-250-CA-J to J7-255-CA-J. The Court likewise ordered the deconsolidation of the present administrative case from the aforementioned administrative complaints, and the referral of this case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation. None of the parties appeared during the mandatory conference before the IBP-Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD).\nOn July 5, 2018, Atty. Mallari submitted a verified position paper, which reiterates the arguments in the March 2017 Compliance and further asserts that the actuations of Justice Bruselas with respect to CA-GR.SP. No. 106838 rendered him bereft of proven competence, integrity, probity and independence, which are the continuing qualifications for judges and magistrates under the Constitution.\nOn February 18, 2020, the Investigating Commissioner of the IBP-CBD issued his Report and Recommendation finding that the Acts of Atty. Mallari were in a violation of his duty to observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of Justice which is necessary for the orderly administration of Justice. The Investigation Commissioner recommended the suspension of Atty. Mallari from the practice of law for two years, with a stem warning that a similar offense will be dealt with more severely.\nThe Investigating Commissioner observed that Atty. Mallari did \"not deny the accusations of disrespect, levelled against him. . . . [I]nstead of refuting the allegations and evidence against him, [he] reiterated his charges and grievances against [Justice Bruselas] and [the CA]. Instead of asserting his defense, [Atty. Mallari] submitted what [the Investigating Commissioner felt] is more of a motion for reconsideration of the decisions rendered by the [CA] and the Supreme Court in the PNB cases.\" While the Investigation Commissioner admitted that lawyers are allowed, and are in fact given much leeway, to criticize judges and judicial decisions, he nevertheless found that Atty. Mallari's debate challenge and accusations against the CA justices went way beyond the bounds of ethically acceptable criticism, and therefore violative of Canon 11 and Rule 11. of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Citing jurisprudence, the IC recommended that Atty. Mallari be suspended for two (2) years. On June 13, 2020, the IBP Board of Governors approved and adopted the recommendation of the Investigation Commissioner of the IBP-CBD. On August 4, 2021, the complete records of the case, together with the abovementioned resolution of the IBP Board of Governors, were transmitted to this Court.\nThe Court approves and adopts the factual findings and recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner and the IBP Board of Governors.\nAs noted by the Investigating Commissioner, Atty. Mallari plainly admits to writing and causing the publication in two national newspapers of a public debate challenge against an incumbent magistrate of the Court of Appeals, on the topic of the merits of a decision rendered by said magistrate. We quote verbatim the debate challenge as published in the November 7, 2012 edition of the Philippine Daily Inquirer and the November 8, 2012 edition of the Philippine Star:\nOctober 29, 2012\nHON. APOLINARIO D. BRUSELAS, JR. Associate Justice Court of Appeals Ma. Orosa St., Ermita Manila\nSIR:\nI am challenging you to a public and televised debate on the topic:\n\"The Court of Appeals' SPECIAL FOURTH DIVISION OF FIVE AMENDED DECISION , dated 24 February 2011, In CA-GR.SP.

ELIGIO P. MALLARI President & Former Commissioner, Commission on Human Rights (CHR)\nAdditionally, Atty. Mallari likewise admits the existence of another advertisement published in Sun Star Issue, page 3, Tuesday, January 7, 2014, with the topic \"A CHALLENGE TO NINE (9) COURT OF APPEALS JUSTICES TO A DEBATE \"(ANNEX \"M-2\" PJ Reyes, Justices Bruselas, Jr., Dimaampao[,] Tijam, Sorongon and Inting).\"\nIt must be underscored at the outset that Atty. Mallari's claims as to the nullity of the Amended Decision are presently unfounded, since that very issue is still pending resolution before this Court. Atty. Mallari admits that he filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari Assailing the Amended Decision before the Court, which was docketed as G.R. No. 204743. Atty. Mallari admits that \"th[is] Judicial remedy filed by [him] in [the form of a] Petition for Review on Certiorari in G.R. No. 204743 (CA-G.R. NO. 106838)\" is still pending. He likewise admits that the petition \"raises . . . 1aшphi1 . ONLY QUESTIONS of LAW, namely:\nI. WHETHER OR NOT THE ORDER\/DECISION DATED 22 JANUARY 2008 BY RTC BRANCH 215, QUEZON CITY, WHICH HAS ALREADY ATTAINED FINALITY AND PARTIALLY EXECUTED, CAN STILL BE ASSAILED VIA PETITION FOR CERTIORARI.\nII. WHETHER OR NOT A PETITION FOR CERTIORARI CAN BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR A LOST APPEAL.\nIII. WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES WHICH ATTAINED FINALITY AND FULLY EXECUTED, THRU THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM (DAR), CAN BE IMPLIEDLY ASSAILED AND REVERSED BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF OUR GOVERNMENT.\nVerily, the issue of whether the Amended Decision is valid or void has now been brought under the jurisdiction of this Court at the instance of Atty. Mallari; and it is this Court alone that is authorized by law to render a final ruling in the matter. Without such final ruling, Atty. Mallari's incessant and insistent characterization of the Amended Decision as void is merely self-serving. Moreover, as explained below, challenging the ponente of a decision to publicly debates on the merits of the same even while it is pending review before a superior court betrays the challenger's contempt, disrespect, and distrust of both the deciding court and the reviewing court.\nIt bears stressing that the present debate challenge had already been brought to the attention of this Court in the previous disbarment complaint against Atty. Mallari. The complainant therein alleged, inter alia, that\n[a]side from his own personal experience with [Atty. Mallari], [there are other cases and instances involving [Atty. Mallari] which showcased [his] propensity to deceive, his unethical behavior, and his abusive use of power as a member of the bar:\n. . . .\nOn October 29, 2012, [Atty. Mallari] paid advertisements published in the Philippine Star and the Philippine Daily Inquirer, challenging Court of Appeals' Associate Justice Apolinario D. Bruselas, Jr. to a \"public and televised debate\" in relation to an issuance in the case entitled \"PNB v. Eligio P. Mallari, et al.\"\nWhen sought for comment on the allegation, Atty. Mallari \"claimed it was his right as an officer of the court to mount such challenge because the latter issued a \"VOID\" [decision and] resolution.\" Accordingly, the Investigating Commissioner of the Committee on Integrity and Bar Discipline made the following findings in Genato v. Atty. Mallari, which we approvingly quote:\n1. Respondent [Atty. Mallari]'s published challenge to an Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals to a \"public and televised debate\" was an utter disregard of Section 20, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, which reminds [Atty. Mallari] as an officer of the court:\ni. To maintain allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines and to support the Constitution and obey the laws of the Philippines;\nii. To observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers.\nAs a lawyer, [Atty. Mallari] was put to task by the Investigating Commissioner to know that Judges and Justices from first level courts, Regional Trial Courts, Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals, Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court would decide cases based only on law and evidence, and there would be remedies and proper venues to challenge their decisions, resolutions, or orders. According to the Investigating Commissioner, this would not include challenging a Justice to a public and televised debate. Too, the Lawyer's Oath emphasized the obligation of members of the bar to \"obey the laws as well as the legal orders of the duly constituted authorities.\" The Investigating Commissioner concluded that [Atty. Mallari] violated the following provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility:\nCanon 1 - A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes.\nRule 1. - A lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system\n. . . .\nCanon 10 - A lawyer owes candor, fairness and good faith to the courts.\nRule 10. - A lawyer shall observe the rules of procedure and shall not misuse them to defeat the ends of justice.\nCanon 11 - A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to Judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct by others.\nBy repeatedly describing the Amended Decision as \"void\" despite the pendency of his own appeal from the same, and by demanding that Justice Bruselas defend the merits of said decision through a public debate, Atty. Mallari publicized his disrespect, not only to the members of the CA, but also to the very concept of appellate procedure. The Court has thoroughly perused Atty. Mallari's March 2017 Compliance and finds it to be a reiteration of his legal arguments against the Amended Decision. Essentially, he uses the present case as an opportunity to raise the same exact arguments which are still pending consideration before the Court in G.R. No. 204743. Worse, he also unabashedly admits to using the debate challenge as a new opportunity to relitigate the already-dismissed administrative complaints that he filed against the CA justices:\n2. The \"CHALLENGE TO A PUBLIC DEBATE\" against the NINE (9) CA Justices who rendered the CA \"VOID\" AMENDED DECISION dated February 24, 2011 and the CA \"VOID\" RESOLUTION Dated December 5, 2012 that AFFIRMED the CA \"VOID\" AMENDED DECISION dated February 24, 2011 . . . was an HONEST AND IN [sic] GOOD FAITH move by Atty. Eligio P. Mallari, the owner of Lots 3664 and 3843, TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW and TO CLEANSE THE JUDICIARY OF \"MISFITS\", after ALL the Administrative Charges filed by him against the said NINE CA Justices were ALL DISMISSED by the Honorable Court\n. . . .\n3. At least, when the Honorable Court keeps on DISMISSING the VERIFIED COMPLAINTS with the attached CERTIFIED COPIES of the documents to support his allegations and charges against the HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS JUSTICES who rendered the CA \"VOID\" AMENDED DECISION dated February 24, 2011 and the CA \"VOID\" RESOLUTION dated December 5, 2012 that AFFIRMED the CA \"VOID\" AMENDED DECISION dated February 24, 2011, the Complainant Atty. Eligio P. Mallari has still another venue to ventilate the INJUSTICES and COVER-UP COMMITTED and PERPETUATED by the JUDICIARY against him, RELATIVE to the PNB's \"LONG PRESCRIBED\" Petition for Certiorari in CA-G.R. SP No. 106838 and the WRONG REMEDY OF CERTIORARI for PNB had already AVAILED of an APPEAL in the RTC. but, LOST IT. (Underlining supplied, emphasis and capitalization in the original)\nSuch use of the administrative disciplinary process for the purpose of what is essentially forum-shopping is not only a flagrant mockery of legal procedure, but also an intolerable vexation upon Justice Bruselas, Jr. and his colleagues in the appellate court.\nAtty. Mallari's contemptuous attitude towards the CA justices who rendered the Amended Decision is further revealed in his subsequent pleadings. Apart from painting his legal arguments as undisputed facts, he accuses the CA justices of cowardice and reckless ambition:\n11. DO THE CA NINE [sic] JUSTICES HAVE SOMETHING TO FEAR that they could NOT SUSTAIN their said \"VOID\" DECISIONS IN THE CHALLENGE [sic] PUBLIC DEBATE, and instead sought REFUGE to [sic] the Honorable Supreme Court, which in turn ordered Atty. Eligio P. Mallari to SHOW CAUSE why he should NOT be disciplinary dealt [sic] for having violated the Code of Professional Responsibility[?]\n. . . .\n15. The Respondents CA Justices are STILL NOT SATISFIED with their respective positions in the Court of Appeals, but LONGING for the HIGHER positions as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court wherein they could UNLEASHED [sic] and PERPETUATE their acts of GROSS IGNORANCE OF THE LAW, GROSS DISHONESTY and GROSS MISCONDUCT or DISPLAY their LACK of competence, integrity, probity, and independence pursuant to the provisions of Article VIII. Section 7(3) of the Constitution.\nAre [sic] the CA NINE (9) JUSTICES HAVE SOMETHING TO FEAR that they COULD NOT SUSTAIN their said \"VOID\" DECISIONS IN THE CHALLENGE PUBLIC DEBATE [sic], and instead sought REFUGE to [sic] the Honorable Supreme Court, which in turn ORDERED Atty. Eligio P. Mallari to SHOW CAUSE why he should not be disciplinar[il]y dealt with for challenging the CA NINE (9) Justices to a PUBLIC DEBATE for having violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. [sic]\nAre the NINE (9) CA JUSTICES NOT covered by Professional Responsibility WHEN THEY PROMULGATED the INSUFFICIENT CA DECISION dated August 11, 2009, the CA \"VOID\" AMENDED DECISION dated February 24, 2011 and the CA \"VOID\" RESOLUTION dated December 5, 2012?\nHow do we explain the unusual interest that some justices exhibit when a juicy case (130. HECTARES LOT 3664 AND THE 6,338 SQ. M. LOT 3843 OF THE SAN FERNANDO CADASTRE, PAMPANGA) is tossed to them for adjudication? (Emphasis in the original)\nAtty. Mallari further justifies the debate challenge by claiming that \"[b]ased upon the unlawful delays and developments of the cases involving Lots 3664 and 3843, the availment of judicial remedies is not effective in favor of the Spouses Eligio P. Mallari and Marcelina H. Mallari who have been the registered owners since May 19, 2010 (Lot 3843) under TCT No. 042­2010005790 and February 16, 2012 (Lot 3664) under TCT No. 042-­2012002031 . . .\" Verily, Atty. Mallari's vituperative statements and presumptuous challenges against appellate judges, made not only in newspapers of general circulation, but even in pleadings before the Supreme Court, reveal his disrespect and distrust, not only to the Court of Appeals, but to the whole judiciary. While lawyers are encouraged to advocate for their causes with the utmost zeal and passion, they are nevertheless bound by law and ethics to avoid opprobrium and baseless accusations against judges and tribunals who rule against them and their clients.\nJurisprudence is replete with cases of lawyers losing sight of their ethical responsibilities to the judiciary and to society due to an obstinate and intransigent adherence to the merits of their own causes. This Court reiterates that criticism and analysis of judicial rulings by lawyers must be made within ethically acceptable bounds. As officers of the court, lawyers are given the freedom, not only to air grievances against judges and magistrates, but also to analyze, dissect, and criticize judicial decisions. However, lawyers are likewise obliged to exercise these rights in the spirit of good faith, decency, and propriety, in a manner which does not degrade public confidence in the judicial system. As eloquently emphasized by jurists both here and abroad:\nTo curtail the right of a lawyer to be critical of the foibles of courts and judges is to seal the lips of those in the best position to give advice and who might consider it their duty to speak disparagingly. \"Under such a rule,\" so far as the bar is concerned, \"the merits of a sitting judge may be rehearsed, but as to his demerits there must be profound silence.\" (State v. Circuit Court, 72 N.W. 196)\nBut it is the cardinal condition of all such criticism that it shall be bona fide, and shall not spill over the walls of decency and propriety. A wide chasm exists between fair criticism, on the one hand, and abuse and slander of courts and the judges thereof, on the other. Intemperate and unfair criticism is a gross violation of the duty of respect to courts. It is such a misconduct that subjects a lawyer to disciplinary action.\nFurther in Bradley v. Fisher, the U.S. Supreme Court held:\nControversies involving not merely great pecuniary interests, but the liberty and character of the parties, and consequently exciting the deepest feelings, are being constantly determined in those courts, in which there is great conflict in the evidence and great doubt as to the law which should govern their, decision. It is this class of cases which impose upon the judge the severest labor, and often create in his mind a painful sense of responsibility. Yet it is precisely in this class of cases that the losing party feels most keenly the decision against him, and most readily accepts anything but the soundness of the decision in explanation of the action of the judge. Just in proportion to the strength of his convictions of the correctness of his own view of the case is he apt to complain of the judgment against him, and from complaints of the judgment to pass to the ascription of improper motives to the judge. When the controversy involves questions affecting large amounts of property or relates to a matter of general public concern, or touches the interests of numerous parties, the disappointment occasioned by an adverse decision, often finds vent in imputations of this character, and from the imperfection of human nature this is hardly a subject of wonder. If civil actions [or debate challenges] could be maintained in such cases against the judge, because the losing party should see fit to allege in his complaint that the acts of the judge were done with partiality, or maliciously, or corruptly, the protection essential to judicial independence would be entirely swept away. Few persons sufficiently irritated to institute an action against a judge for his judicial acts would hesitate to ascribe any character to the acts which would be essential to the maintenance of the action.\nAt this point, it must be reiterated that Atty. Mallari's accusations of bad faith, corruption, and intentional rendition of an unjust decision against Justice Bruselas and the other CA justices have been found utterly baseless in this Court's February 21, 2017 Resolution. As pointed out therein, Atty. Mallari presents no proof whatsoever that the issuance of the Amended Decision was tainted with bad faith or corrupt motives. Rather, Atty. Mallari wants this Court to imply such bad faith and corruption from the fact that the Amended Decision was contrary to previous rulings in other related cases involving the same disputed property, which, incidentally, were mostly favorable to him. However, basic is the rule that allegations of bad faith and corruption must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.\" Judges and magistrates cannot be held administratively liable for the mere act of rendering a decision which is unfavorable to the complaining party. The imposition of disciplinary measures against judges and magistrates must be based on actual proof of negligence or misconduct, not mere insinuations and extrapolations.\nIn view of the foregoing findings, we find that Atty. Mallari's public debate challenge against Justice Bruselas violates Rule 138, Section 20(b) of the Rules of Court, as amended, as well as Canons 1, 10, and 11, and Rules 1., 10., and 11. of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\nFurthermore, by publishing, in two newspapers of general circulation, a debate challenge which contains statements regardingand if accepted, would necessarily involve a public discussion ofthe merits of a pending case, Atty. Mallari likewise violated the sub judice rule, as embodied in Canon 13, Rule 13. of the Code of Professional Responsibility. In the published advertisements which he personally signed, Atty. Mallari openly challenged Justice Bruselas \"to prove that your penned Amended Decision, dated [February 24, 2011], is NOT VOID by your giving due course to PNB's lost appeal after you joined more than ONE (1) year ago the CA Fourth Division in dismissing on [August 11, 2009] PNB's petition for certiorari. \" The debate challenge, which explicitly identifies PNB as the opposing party and describes its remedy as a \"lost appeal\", is clearly calculated to arouse public opinion for Atty. Mallari and against PNB. Even as Atty. Mallari admits to have a pending challenge against the Amended Decision, he likewise admits to circulating copies of the said decision, as well the arguments he interposed, to other lawyers:\n11. The copies of the CA \"VOID\" AMENDED DECISION dated February 24, 2011 and the CA \"VOID \" RESOLUTION dated December 5, 2012, that AFFIRMED the CA \"VOID\" AMENDED DECISION dated February 24, 2011, with the attached documents\/decisions\/ resolutions\/orders and JUSTIFICATIONS\" why they are \"VOID\" had been CIRCULATED\/DISSEMINATED to ALMOST all the Members of the Bar, and maybe they are, like the Complainant Atty. Eligio P. Mallari are WAITING for the Respondents CA Justices' \"REASONS ONLY KNOWN TO THEM\" when they rendered the CA \"VOID\" AMENDED DECISION dated February 24, 2011 and the CA \"VOID\" RESOLUTION dated December 5, 2012.\nAs adverted to earlier, Atty. Mallari willingly admits that he advertised the debate challenge with the intention of publicizing his grievances against the magistrates who rendered the Amended Decision against him after 37 years of litigation. This Court understands Atty. Mallari's frustrations regarding the long pendency of his case before the primary and appellate courts. Likewise, this Court shares his laudable and lofty goal of ensuring that all who sit on the bench to dispense justice possess the requisite probity, integrity, and independence which comprise the bedrock of a just, reliable, and predictable judicial dispute resolution system. However, as a member of the bar, his actuations on such frustrations and goals must be made within the acceptable bounds of the lawyer's ethical code. Even as they embark on legal and moral crusades, lawyers must never lose sight of their ethical responsibilities as officers of the court and exemplars of the legal system.\nAs regards the sanction imposable on Atty. Mallari, jurisprudence involving published manifestations of disrespect and vitriol towards judges by lawyers consistently impose the penalties of suspension or reprimand. More serious cases have merited suspension, with the duration thereof dependent upon the attendant circumstances. However, we note that Atty. Mallari has already been stricken from the Roll of Attorneys pursuant to our 2019 ruling in Genato v. Atty. Mallari (Genato). As mentioned earlier, the debate challenge against Justice Bruselas formed part of the bases for his disbarment therein:\nA lawyer must respect the\nduly constituted authority\nIt is a lawyer's sworn duty to maintain a respectful attitude towards the courts. There is, thus, no rhyme or reason for [Atty. Mallari]'s reprehensible and arrogant behavior in challenging a Justice of the Court of Appeals to a public debate. Even assuming that the decision rendered by a magistrate is, according to the losing lawyer, erroneous and completely devoid of basis in law, evidence, and jurisprudence, a person, let alone a lawyer, should not act contemptuously by challenging the judge or justice concerned to a public debate that would unavoidably expose him or her and the entire Judiciary which he or she represents, to public ridicule and mockery.\nA lawyer must foster respect for the courts and its officers. A lawyer must not sow hate or disrespect against the court and its members. He or she must be at the forefront in upholding its dignity. A lawyer, more than anyone, must know that there are proper venues for grievances against a magistrate or his or her decision or orders, which are sanctioned by law. Debate, a public one at that, is not one of these remedies.\nBy provoking a sitting Justice of the Court of Appeals to a debate, [Atty. Mallari] violated his basic obligation under the Rules of Court to obey the laws of the Philippines, and to observe and maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers. He also transgressed Rule 11., Canon II of the Code of Professional Responsibility...\n. . . .\nThe power to disbar is always exercised with great caution and only for the most imperative reasons or in cases of clear misconduct affecting the standing and moral character of the lawyer as an officer of the court and member of the bar. The Court has to ask itself whenever this remedy is considered  Do the transgressions of the erring lawyer justify his or her disbarment? What circumstances in the erring lawyer's life can we draw upon to avoid disbarment as an outcome? Would the legal profession be better off without this erring lawyer in the Roll of Attorneys, and would others be deterred from following the erring lawyer's type of practice?\nHere, the Court has considered these questions and more. We have found out that [Atty. Mallari] has demonstrated an utter lack of regard for the law, the rules, and the courts by his repeated transgressions, disobedience to court issuances, and arrogant behavior towards not just a sitting Justice of the Court of Appeals but several of them whose names are not recorded here, those other judges and justices who have been the subject of his vituperative style of practicing law.\nIn fact, [Atty. Mallari] was previously suspended for employing dilatory tactics in the enforcement of the decision in Mallari v. GSIS and Provincial Sheriff of Pampanga. By his actions, [Atty. Mallari] had definitely shown to have fallen below the bar set for the legal profession. The Court has repeatedly stressed the importance of integrity and good character as part of a lawyer's equipment in the practice of his profession, because the practice of law is a sacred and noble profession. We do not want this profession to become the subject of ill-will by the public and source of public disrepute.\n. . . .\nTo cap it all, [Atty. Mallari] has not shown any bit of remorse for his conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the legal profession. He has not seen the errors of his ways, and this is the most troubling occasion for the present case. He is and has been incapable of reform.\n. . . .\nTo repeat, [Atty. Mallari] has repeatedly and deliberately caused a mockery of the judicial profession by his constant transgressions enough to justify a penalty graver than the six-month suspension recommended by the IBP Board of Governors. For, [Atty. Mallari]'s serious administrative offenses, he deserves the ultimate penalty of disbarment. His name should be stricken from the Roll of Attorneys. (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)\nBar discipline proceedings are not punitive in nature. Rather, they are a public welfare measure, in that they are meant to protect the public from persons who are ethically unfit to be part of the legal profession. Bar discipline measures likewise protect not only the courts, but the legal system as a whole, by ensuring that the officers of the courts and duly-authorized advocates of the public are competent, honorable, and reliable. Thus, bar discipline proceedings are in essence, an examination of one's fitness to practice law, and an investigation into the character of a lawyer, as well as his or her misconduct. Due to their non-punitive nature, disbarments and other bar discipline sanctions are not considered punishments for purposes of the double jeopardy clause. Settled is the rule that the double jeopardy principle does not apply to bar discipline cases.\nThus, while jurisprudence instructs that disbarment can no longer be imposed on an already-disbarred lawyer, it also teaches that the Supreme Court retains disciplinary jurisdiction over already-disbarred lawyers, for acts committed during the subsistence of their membership in the bar. This Court retains jurisdiction over suspended or disbarred lawyers insofar as \"[a] judgment of suspension or disbarment is always subject to change or modification by the court,\" which may downgrade a penalty of disbarment to one of suspension, lift a suspension, reinstate a disbarred lawyer, or order such disbarred lawyer to pay a fine. This continuing jurisdiction over interdicted or disbarred lawyers is based on the Supreme Court's constitutional power to promulgate rules and regulations concerning admission to the practice of law.\nConsequently, while a disbarred lawyer may no longer serve a subsequent suspension, such penalty may nevertheless be imposed for the sole purpose of recording the same in the disbarred lawyer's personal file in the Office of the Bar Confidant, which will then be taken into consideration if and when the disbarred lawyer applies for reinstatement. However, such imposition of the unservable penalty for recording purposes presupposes the commission of an infraction distinct and separate from that which the lawyer was previously disbarred. Thus, in Pabalan v. Atty. Salva ( Pabalan ), this Court dismissed a disbarment complaint which was based on the same act as a previous disbarment complaint for which the lawyer had already been sanctioned, thus:\nIn his Answer in the instant case, Salva raised forum shopping as an affirmative defense. This, along with Pabalan's manifestation, should have been enough to alert the IBP. Indeed, the IBP should have already dismissed the instant disbarment complaint because the same grounds raised by Pabalan were already contained in her Sinumpaang Salaysay as a witness in CBD Case No. 09-2382. The instant complaint even contains the same annexes as those attached to her Sinumpaang Salaysay. While Pabalan's allegations were only part of the many other allegations raised by Benito in CBD Case No. 09-­2382, Salva was able to address Pabalan's allegations in his Answer therein. In fact, he even devoted the last few pages of said Answer as a Reply to Pabalan's Sinumpaang Salaysay.\n. . . .\nHence, except for the charge of entering into an agreement with a non-lawyer for the sharing of attorney's fees , all the charges raised against respondent are found to have no factual and legal basis.\nAs gleaned from [the abovequoted findings in the previous disbarment case], the IBP had already considered the allegations of Pabalan against Salva when it ruled on the disbarment complaint filed by Benito in CBD Case No. 09-­2382. To repeat, the allegations of Pabalan in CBD Case No. 09-2382 and in the instant case are the same. Still, the IBP adopted and approved on June 21, 2013 the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner, without even acknowledging its earlier ruling in CBD Case No. 09-2382. (Emphasis in the original)\nAs applied to Atty. Mallari, on one hand, the debate challenge against Justice Bruselas was only one of several ethically suspect acts which contributed to his disbarment in Genato. Likewise, Justice Bruselas and the other CA justices had no participation therein, either as parties or witnesses. Furthermore, the pleadings and evidence submitted in the present case involved certain aspects of the debate challenge which were not fully considered in Genato: aspects which hereby illume the full extent of Atty. Mallari's transgression of the Code of Professional Responsibility in relation to the said act. Jurisprudence also supports the proposition that a single act may result in the violation of multiple laws, or of multiple provisions of the same law or rules.\nOn the other hand, noteworthy is the fact that Atty. Mallari invoked the same the defense in both Genato and in the case at bar. Justice Bruselas's non-participation in Genato is likewise immaterial since disbarment is solely an inquiry into the lawyer's fitness to practice law and does not involve the grant of reliefs to the complaining party. Crucially, as discussed in the abovequoted excerpts from Genato, the fact remains that Atty. Mallari has already been sanctioned for issuing the debate challenge against Justice Bruselas.\nIn view of the foregoing circumstances, considering the ruling in Pabalan, it is our considered opinion that the present complaint should be dismissed on the sole ground that the unethical acts subject thereof have already been passed upon and considered as grounds for Atty. Mallari's disbarment in a previous case. However, bearing in mind the gravity of Atty. Mallari's offense and the public welfare purpose of bar discipline cases, in the exercise of its sui generis prerogatives regarding bar membership, this Court nevertheless rules that the present decision must be made part of Atty. Mallari's disciplinary record, for consideration in case he applies for reinstatement to the Roll of Attorneys, and to apprise the bench, the bar, and all other concerned parties, of the full ethical implications of his public vituperations against the Justice Bruselas and his colleagues in the appellate court.\nACCORDINGLY, the present complaint is hereby DISMISSED, in view of the circumstances of Eligio P. Mallari's disbarment in the case of Antonio X. Genato v. Atty. Eligio P. Mallari.\nLet a copy of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to Eligio P. Mallari's personal record. Likewise, let copies of the same be served on the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator, which is directed to circulate them to all courts in the country, for their information and guidance.\nSO ORDERED.\nGesmundo, C.J., Leonen, SAJ., Caguioa, Hernando, Lazaro-Javier, Zalameda, M.

{"id":6034,"text":"Manila\nTHIRD DIVISION\n[ A.C. No. 13548. June 14, 2023 ]\nCELIA D. MENDOZA, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. CESAR R. SANTIAGO, JR., RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nGAERLAN, J.:\nBefore the Court is a Complaint dated June 23, 2017 filed by Celia D. Mendoza (complainant) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP)-Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) against Atty. Cesar R. Santiago, Jr. (respondent) for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.\nThe Facts\nComplainant claims that she is one of the heirs of Adela Espiritu-­Barlaan, who died intestate on September 4, 2010, leaving no descendant or ascendant, but with brothers and sisters. Adela Espiritu-Barlaan also left a parcel of land with an area of 247 square meters, registered under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 2133 with Free Patent No. MT-007-602-94-2003 located in Pembo, Makati City (subject property).\nOn October 25, 2013, Gemma S. Barlaan, wife of the late Felimon Gundran Barlaan, and their children, namely: Ma. Theresa Barlaan, Michael Robert Barlaan, Fheljohn Barlaan, Jonathan Barlaan, and John Alexander Barlaan, executed an Extrajudicial Settlement with Waiver and Transfer of Rights, adjudicating to themselves the subject property. The Extrajudicial Settlement with Waiver and Transfer of Rights was acknowledged before and notarized by respondent in his notarial book.\nBy virtue of the Extrajudicial Settlement with Waiver and Transfer of Rights, OCT No. 2133 was cancelled and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 006-2014001250 was issued in the name of John Alexander Barlaan. Thereafter, John Alexander Barlaan sold 147 square meters of the subject property to Monette Abac Ramos for P3,130,000. as evinced by the Deed of Absolute Sale dated November 26, 2014 (First Deed of Sale). The First Deed of Sale was acknowledged before and notarized by respondent in his notarial book.\nOn March 12, 2015, John Alexander Barlaan executed another Deed of Absolute Sale (Second Deed of Sale) covering the same 147 square meters of the subject property in favor of Monette Abac Ramos for P1,500,000.. The Second Deed of Sale was, likewise, acknowledged before and notarized by respondent in his notarial book. TCT No. 006-2014001250 was then cancelled, and TCT No. 006-2015000698 covering 100 square meters of the subject property was issued in favor of John Alexander Barlaan, while TCT No. 006-2015000699 covering 147 square meters of the subject property was issued in favor of Monette Abac Ramos.\nMonette Abac Ramos then filed a Complaint for Ejectment dated May 12, 2015 after discovering that the 147-square meter property she bought from John Alexander Barlaan was occupied by other relatives of Adela Espiritu-Barlaan (the original owner of the subject property). Attached to the Complaint was her Judicial Affidavit, where she narrated that, as shown by the First Deed of Sale, she bought the 147-square meter property from John Alexander Barlaan for ₱3,130,000.. 1âшphi1\nOn July 27, 2016, the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Makati City rendered its Decision, ruling in favor of Monette Abac Ramos, and directing the defendants therein to vacate and surrender possession of the 147-square meter property.\nOn June 23, 2017, complainant filed the instant Complaint, praying that respondent be disbarred on the ground that his act of notarizing the First and Second Deeds of Sale is a violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.\nOn July 4, 2018, respondent filed his Answer, arguing that: (1) complainant has no legal personality to file the disbarment complaint against him and that the issue of ownership of the subject property has already been resolved with finality; and (2) the act of notarizing the First and Second Deeds of Sale with different amounts is of no moment because he has already discharged his official functions as a notary public when he submitted the documents, in particular, the Second Deed of Sale, to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Register of Deeds of Makati City.\nReport and Recommendation of the IBP-CBD\nOn June 17, 2021, the IBP-CBD issued its Report and Recommendation, recommending that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year, and that his notarial commission be revoked for a period of two years:\nWHEREFORE, based on the facts and evidence presented, the complainant has sufficiently proven by means of preponderance of evidence her case against the respondent. It is recommended that respondent Atty. Cesar R. Santiago, Jr. be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year and that his notarial commission, if there is any, be revoked for (2) years.\nIn resolving the case against respondent, the IBP-CBD first ruled that complainant has legal personality to file the administrative complaint because she was able to establish that she has personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances of respondent's violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. The IBP-CBD, likewise, found that respondent's act of notarizing the First and Second Deeds of Sale, which was indubitably done to minimize his client's liability from paying taxes, violated the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\nResolution of the IBP Board of Governors\nOn August 28, 2001, the IBP Board of Governors issued a Resolution, affirming the findings of the CBD, but modifying the penalty imposed upon respondent, thus:\nRESOLUTION NO. CBD-XXV-2021-08-32 CBD Case No. 17-5424 Celia D. Mendoza vs. Atty. Cesar R. Santiago, Jr.\nRESOLVED to MODIFY, as it is hereby MODIFIED, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in the instant case, and instead to recommend the imposition upon Respondent Atty. Cesar R. Santiago of the following penalties  1) SUSPENSION from the practice of law for Two (2) Years; 2) the IMMEDIATE REVOCATION of his Notarial Commission, if subsisting; and 3) DISQUALIFICATION for Two (2) Years from being commissioned as a Notary Public. (Emphases and italics in the original)\nRuling of the Court\nAfter an examination of the records of the case, the Court finds no cogent reason to depart from the findings and recommendations of the IBP Board of Governors.\nTo recall, respondent never disputed that he notarized the First and Second Deeds of Sale, corresponding to the exact same property, but indicating different amounts. In this regard, it is worthy to note that in Monette Abac Ramos' Judicial Affidavit submitted in the ejectment case before the MeTC, she categorically stated that she bought the property for ₱3,130,000. as evinced by the First Deed of Sale, which was acknowledged before and notarized by respondent. However, as borne by the records, what was submitted to the Registry of Deeds of Makati City was the Second Deed of Sale  also acknowledged before and notarized by respondent  indicating the amount of ₱1,500,000., which amount became the basis of the tax liability of respondent's client. Undeniably, and as pointed out by the IBP-CBD, respondent's act of notarizing the First and Second Deeds of Sale was for the purpose of minimizing his client's liability from paying taxes.\nIn Lopez v. Ramos, a case with similar circumstances, the Court exhaustively explained that the act of notarizing two deeds of sale corresponding to the same property, the purpose of which is to minimize the payment of taxes, is a violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and the Code of Professional Responsibility. The Court, thus, imposed the penalty of suspension from the practice of law, and revocation of the notary public's notarial commission:\nBased on Delos Santos' testimony, respondent told her that he drafted and notarized another instrument that did not state the true consideration of the sale, in order to reduce the capital gains tax due on the transaction. Respondent cannot escape liability for making an untruthful statement in a public document for an unlawful purpose. As the second deed indicated an amount lower than the actual price paid for the property sold, respondent abetted in depriving the Government of the right to collect the correct taxes due. Respondent violated Rule 1., Canon 1 of the CPR, to wit:\nCANON 1  A LAWYER SHALL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND PROMOTE RESPECT FOR LAW OF AND LEGAL PROCESSES.\nRule 1.  A lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system.\nRespondent assisted the contracting parties in an activity aimed at defiance of law, and displayed lack of respect for and made a mockery of the solemnity of the oath in an Acknowledgment. When the respondent notarized an illegal and fraudulent document, he is entitling full faith and credit upon the face of the document, which it does not deserve, considering its nature and purpose.\nThe act of notarization is imbued with substantive public interest wherein a private document is converted into a public document, which results in the document's admissibility in evidence without further proof of its authenticity. It is the notary public's duty to observe utmost care in complying with the formalities intended to protect the integrity of the notarized document and the act or acts it embodies. x x x\nx x x x\nAside from the duty of the notary public to ascertain the identity of the affiant and the voluntariness of the declaration, it is also incumbent upon him to guard against any illegal or immoral arrangement or at least refrain from being a party to its consummation. Rule IV, Section 4 (a) of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice prohibits notaries public from performing any notarial act for transactions similar to the subject deeds of sale, x x x\nx x x x\nDespite knowledge of the illegal purpose of evading the payment of proper taxes due, respondent proceeded to notarize the second deed of sale. Instead of accommodating the request of his client, Benjamin, respondent, being a member of the legal profession, should have stood his ground and not yielded to the request of his client. Respondent should have been more prudent and unfaltering in his solemn oath neither to do falsehood nor consent to the doing of any. As a lawyer, respondent is expected at all times to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession and refrain from any act or omission which might lessen the trust and confidence reposed by the public in the integrity of the legal profession.\nx x x x\nWe ruled that the Court may suspend or disbar a lawyer for any misconduct showing any fault or deficiency in his moral character, honesty, probity or good demeanor.\nx x x x\nIn the instant case, we hold that respondent suffer the penalty of suspension and revocation of his notarial commission for two (2) years, for violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. This is in accord with current jurisprudence and the recommendation by the IBP Board of Governors.\nAs regards his suspension from the practice of law, we hold that neither the one-year suspension imposed in Gonzales and in the other cases, nor the six-month suspension recommended by the IBP Board of Governors, is applicable to this case. The one-year and the six-month suspension from the practice of law are not commensurate to the graveness of the respondent's transgressions.\nThe case of Caalim-Verzonilla v. Pascua, is analogous to the case at bar. In Caalim-Verzonilla, respondent Pascua prepared and notarized two Deeds of Extra-Judicial Settlement. The two deeds have been executed by and for the benefit of the same parties, and have identical registration, page and book numbers in the notarial portion. In addition, the two deeds were alleged to have been falsified, and have different considerations, with the end purpose of evading the payment of correct taxes. In Caalim-Verzonilla, the Court suspended Pascua from practicing law for a period of two (2) years, revoked his notarial commission, disqualified him from reappointment as a notary public for a period of two (2) years, and gave him a warning that any similar act or infraction in the future shall be dealt with more sternly.\nThus, with respect to respondent's suspension from the practice of law, we hold that respondent's failure to faithfully comply with the rules on notarial practice, and his violation of his oath as lawyer when he prepared and notarized the second deed for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the correct amount of taxes, shall be meted with a penalty of a two (2)-year suspension from the practice of law. The said penalty is proper and commensurate to the infraction committed by respondent. (Emphases supplied; citations omitted)\nPertinently, in Section 33(p), Canon VI of A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, or the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), a violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice is considered a serious offense. Once found guilty of a serious offense, a lawyer may be met with the following sanctions, as provided by Section 37(a), Canon VI of the CPRA:\nSECTION 37. Sanctions. \n(a) If the respondent is found guilty of a serious offense, any of the following sanctions, or a combination thereof, shall be imposed:\n(1) Disbarment;\n(2) Suspension from the practice of law for a period exceeding six (6) months;\n(3) Revocation of notarial commission and disqualification as notary public for not less than two (2) years; or\n(4) A fine not exceeding Php100,000..\nApplying all the foregoing to the instant case, the Court finds no reason to depart from the findings and recommendations of the IBP Board of Governors, imposing upon respondent the penalties of: (1) suspension from the practice of law for a period of two years; (2) immediate revocation of his notarial commission, if subsisting; and (3) disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public for a period of two years.\nAs a final note, the Court deems it imperative to remind notaries public that the act of notarization is not an empty, meaningless and routinary act. As elucidated in Gonzales v. Atty. Ramos:\nNotarization is not an empty, meaningless routinary act. It is invested with substantive public interest. The notarization by a notary public converts a private document into a public document, making it admissible in evidence without further proof of its authenticity. A notarial document is, by law, entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. A notary public must observe with utmost care the basic requirements in the performance of their duties; otherwise, the public's confidence in the integrity of the document would be undermined.\nWHEREFORE, respondent Atty. Cesar R. Santiago, Jr. is found GUILTY of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and Canon VI of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. He is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of two (2) years; his notarial commission is hereby REVOKED, effective immediately; and he is hereby DISQUALIFIED from being commissioned as a notary public for a pe1iod of two (2) years. He is, likewise, STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future will be dealt with more severely. He is DIRECTED to report the date of receipt of this Decision in order to determine when his suspension shall take effect.\nLet copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be attached to the personal record of respondent Atty. Cesar R. Santiago, Jr.; the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all lower courts; and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, for proper guidance and information.\nSO ORDERED.\nCaguioa, (Chairperson), Inting, Dimaampao, and Singh, JJ., concur.\n","label":[[24,38,"CASE_NUM"],[40,53,"PROM_DATE"],[56,72,"PERSON"],[91,119,"PERSON"],[200,213,"PROM_DATE"],[223,239,"PERSON"],[265,298,"INS"],[300,303,"INS"],[305,333,"INS"],[335,338,"INS"],[348,376,"PERSON"],[411,446,"STA"],[455,486,"STA"],[549,572,"PERSON"],[682,704,"PERSON"],[940,956,"PERSON"],[975,998,"PERSON"],[1032,1047,"PERSON"],[1049,1071,"PERSON"],[1073,1089,"PERSON"],[1091,1107,"PERSON"],[1113,1135,"PERSON"],[1587,1609,"PERSON"],[1623,1645,"PERSON"],[1696,1714,"PERSON"],[1933,1955,"PERSON"],[2089,2107,"PERSON"],[2378,2400,"PERSON"],[2505,2523,"PERSON"],[2525,2543,"PERSON"],[2669,2691,"PERSON"],[2727,2749,"PERSON"],[2957,2979,"PERSON"],[3027,3051,"INS"],[3053,3057,"INS"],[3116,3134,"PERSON"],[4016,4042,"INS"],[4118,4125,"INS"],[4148,4155,"INS"],[4563,4585,"PERSON"],[4772,4779,"PERSON"],[4998,5033,"STA"],[5042,5073,"STA"],[5079,5086,"INS"],[5269,5301,"STA"],[5321,5356,"STA"],[5376,5379,"INS"],[5380,5398,"INS"],[5423,5426,"INS"],[5427,5445,"INS"],[5497,5500,"INS"],[5593,5613,"CASE_NUM"],[5614,5630,"PERSON"],[5641,5658,"PERSON"],[5857,5874,"PERSON"],[6315,6318,"INS"],[6319,6337,"INS"],[6551,6569,"PERSON"],[6633,6637,"INS"],[6866,6898,"INS"],[7135,7142,"INS"],[7289,7294,"PERSON"],[7298,7303,"PERSON"],[7534,7565,"STA"],[7574,7609,"STA"],[7756,7768,"PERSON"],[8319,8322,"INS"],[9703,9734,"STA"],[10920,10951,"STA"],[11028,11031,"INS"],[11032,11050,"INS"],[11241,11244,"INS"],[11245,11263,"INS"],[11446,11463,"PERSON"],[11467,11473,"PERSON"],[11511,11528,"PERSON"],[11541,11547,"PERSON"],[11932,11949,"PERSON"],[11971,11977,"PERSON"],[12831,12851,"CASE_NUM"],[12860,12914,"STA"],[12916,12920,"STA"],[12942,12973,"STA"],[13143,13147,"STA"],[14746,14768,"PERSON"],[14802,14833,"STA"],[14854,14908,"STA"],[15455,15482,"INS"],[15541,15563,"PERSON"],[15569,15602,"INS"],[15650,15683,"INS"],[15734,15741,"PERSON"],[15758,15764,"PERSON"],[15766,15775,"PERSON"],[15781,15786,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6035,"text":"Manila\nTHIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 253531. July 10, 2023 ]\nELIZABETH VIDAL-PLUCENA, PETITIONER, VS. HON. FLAVIANO BALGOS, JR., HARVEY GLENN VALENCIA, AND MRS. FRANSON VALENCIA, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nSINGH, J.:\nThis Petition for Review on Certiorari filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court by petitioner Elizabeth Vidal-Plucena ( Plucena ) assails the Orders, dated March 9, 2020 and July 20, 2020, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 30, Bambang, Nueva Ecija ( RTC ) in Civil Case No. 1409. The RTC dismissed Plucena's complaint for Recovery of Possession and Damages.\nThe Facts\nIn her Complaint for Recovery of Possession and Damages, Plucena averred that she is the registered owner of a parcel of land located in Balungao, San Leonardo, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya, which is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title ( TCT ) No. T-19220. According to Plucena, she had been tilling the land since the 1980's, as she inherited the same from her late parents.\nPlucena averred that, sometime in, 2013, she was surprised to see that someone had entered and fenced a portion of the subject land, and that small concrete houses and pigpens had been erected therein without her consent. Upon further inquiry, Plucena and her sister, Ruth G. Vidal ( Ruth ), learned that the owner of the pigpens and small houses were then Mayor Flaviano Balgos, Jr. ( Mayor Balgos ) and Franson Valencia ( Mrs. Franson ) (collectively, the respondents ). According to Plucena's neighbors, Mayor Balgos and Mrs. Franson ordered the construction of the small houses and the pigpens. When confronted, Mrs. Franson claimed that they owned the lot where the small houses and pigpens were erected. This prompted Plucena to raise her concern to Mayor Balgos, but the same fell on deaf ears.\nPlucena then had the subject land surveyed in order to know the exact portion which was illegally occupied by the respondents. The survey showed that the portion fenced and occupied by the respondents, which was more or less 60 square meters, belonged to Ruth. Plucena claimed that an estimated portion measuring about 60 square meters of the subject land was unlawfully occupied by the respondents. To prove her ownership over the subject land, Plucena presented a tax declaration under her name, which showed that the entire property has an assessed value of ₱34,160.. Thus, Plucena prayed that the respondents be ordered to vacate the subject land and that the improvements erected therein be removed.\nIn their Answer, the respondents questioned the RTC's jurisdiction over the subject matter. The respondents claimed that the assessed value of ₱34,160. for the entire property cannot be the basis for determining the jurisdiction of the RTC, as the same should be based on the assessed value only of the 60 square meters allegedly encroached by the respondents. According to the respondents, the total assessed value of Plucena's entire property is merely ₱204., more or less. Thus, the respondents aver that jurisdiction over the subject matter belongs with the Municipal Trial Court.\nThe Ruling of the RTC\nIn an Order, dated March 9, 2020, the RTC dismissed the Complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to the RTC, the complaint revealed that only 60 square meters is sought to be recovered from the respondents, and not the entire property. The RTC held that the basis in determining the assessed value of the property for purposes of determining which court has jurisdiction should be the portion sought to be recovered in the Complaint, and not the entire property.\nPlucena filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated June 16, 2020, which was denied by the RTC in the Order, dated July 20, 2020. 1aшphi1\nAggrieved, Plucena filed the present Petition before the Court. In essence, she claims that the RTC erred in dismissing her Complaint for Recovery of Possession for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. According to Plucena, although her claim over the subject of the case involved only a portion of 60 square meters, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended by Republic Act No. 7691, does not distinguish whether the title to or interest in the property be in whole or in part. Moreover, she argued that there is no separate tax declaration for the 60-square meter portion of the lot.\nIn their Comment, the respondents reiterated that the basis to determine which court has jurisdiction should be the assessed value of the 60-square meter portion sought to be recovered, and not the assessed value of the entire 10,000-square meter lot.\nThe respondents likewise pointed out that Plucena has previously filed a Petition involving the same issues, docketed as G.R. No. 254294, and which was denied by the Court.\nIn her Reply, Plucena admitted that a prior Petition of the same nature was filed by her sister Ruth, docketed as G.R. No. 254294, which was denied by the Court for lack of merit. However, Plucena insists that the present Petition should be given due course as the facts and circumstances require the Court's interpretation of the law.\nThe Issue\nDid the RTC err in dismissing the Complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter?\nThe Ruling of the Court\nThe Petition is denied. 1aшphi1\nThe Petition raises questions of facts, which are generally outside the province of a Rule 45 petition. The Court emphasizes that a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is limited to questions of law, as factual questions are not the proper subject of an appeal by certiorari. This Court will not review facts, as it is not our function to analyze or weigh all over again evidence already considered in the proceedings below. While this rule is not absolute, none of the recognized exceptions, which allow the Court to review factual issues, is present in the case.\nThe resolution of the issue of whether the assessed value of the entire 10,000-square meter lot, or that of the claimed 60-square meter portion of the same should be the basis in determining which court has jurisdiction over the subject matter is concededly a question of law.\nNevertheless, it will involve a determination of facts because the Court will have to inquire into the details of the valuation of the subject land, the size of the occupied portion, its location, and the valuation of such portion, not to mention the improvements erected by the respondents, are all questions of fact.\nMoreover, the Court notes that Plucena comes directly to this Court via a Rule 45 petition on alleged pure questions of law. Under the principle of hierarchy of courts, direct recourse to this Court is improper because the Court is a court of last resort and must remain to be so in order for it to satisfactorily perform its constitutional functions, thereby allowing it to devote its time and attention to matters within its exclusive jurisdiction and preventing the overcrowding of its docket.\nTo reiterate, the filing of the case directly with this Court runs afoul of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. Pursuant to this doctrine, direct resort from the lower courts to the Court will not be entertained unless the appropriate remedy cannot be obtained in the lower tribunals. The Court is a court of last resort, and must so remain if it is to satisfactorily perform the functions assigned to it by the Constitution and immemorial tradition.\nSubstantially, the Court finds that the RTC did not commit any reversible error in dismissing Plucena's Complaint for lack of jurisdiction.\nNothing is more settled in procedural law than the rule that jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint, including the character of the reliefs prayed for.\nBatas Pambansa Blg. 129 is clear:\nSEC. 19. Jurisdiction in civil cases.  The Regional Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction:\nx x x x\n(2) In all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein, where the assessed value of the property involved exceeds Twenty [T]housand [P]esos ([P]20,000.) or for civil actions in Metro Manila, where such value exceeds Fifty thousand pesos ([P]50,000.) except actions for forcible entry into and unlawful detainer of lands or buildings, original jurisdiction over which is conferred upon the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts.\nLikewise, Section 33(3) of the same law reads:\nSEC. 33. Jurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts in Civil Cases.  Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts shall exercise:\nx x x x\n(3) Exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil actions which involve title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein where the assessed value of the property or interest therein does not exceed Twenty [T]housand [P]esos ([P]20,000.) or, in civil actions in Metro Manila, where such assessed value does not exceed Fifty [T]housand [P]esos ([P]50,000.) exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses and costs: Provided, That in cases of land not declared for taxation purposes, the value of such property shall be determined by the assessed value of the adjacent lots. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nClearly, both the First and Second Level Courts exercise original jurisdiction over actions involving title to or possession of real property or any interest therein, but it is the assessed value of the realty involved which ordains which court shall acquire exclusive jurisdiction over a real action such as in this case.\nHere, Plucena admits that she only seeks to recover from the respondents a 60-square meter portion of her 10,000-square meter land. To prove ownership of the same, Plucena presented TCT No. T-19220, as well as a tax declaration, which showed that the entire 10,000-square meter property has an assessed value of ₱34,160., which falls within the RTC's jurisdiction. Plucena averred that there is no separate tax declaration which shows the assessed value of the 60-square meter portion sought to be recovered. Here, she argues that the assessed value of the entire property should control.\nThe Court does not agree. The RTC correctly held:\nIt is quite clear therefore that what determines jurisdiction is assessed value of the \"property involved\" or \"interest therein.\" Surely, there could no other (sic) \"property involved\" or \"interest therein\" in this case than the 60 square meters portion allegedly encroached and occupied by and being recovered in this suit from the defendants. The assessed value of the entire ONE HECTARE property in the name of the plaintiff could not be the basis in determining the court's jurisdiction because such entire property is not involved in this case.\nTo add, Section 33(3) of BP 129 clearly refers to \"the assessed value of the property or interest therein. The party-plaintiff, Plucena, in this case, cannot be given the discretion as to which assessed value to use; otherwise, it will be an unintended license to forum shop.\nThe 60-square meter portion can always be the subject of segregation and thus, its approximate value can be easily determined through the extant records which, in this case, is a tax declaration. However, Plucena failed to do so.\nWHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED . The Orders, dated March 9, 2020, and July 20, 2020, of the Regional Trial Court, in Civil Case No. 1409, are AFFIRMED .\nSO ORDERED.\nCaguioa (Chairperson), Inting, Gaerlan, and Dimaampao, JJ., concur.\n","label":[[24,39,"CASE_NUM"],[41,54,"PROM_DATE"],[57,80,"PERSON"],[103,123,"PERSON"],[125,146,"PERSON"],[157,173,"PERSON"],[310,333,"PERSON"],[336,343,"PERSON"],[372,385,"PROM_DATE"],[390,403,"PROM_DATE"],[412,432,"INS"],[468,471,"INS"],[477,496,"CASE_NUM"],[502,505,"INS"],[516,523,"PERSON"],[643,650,"PERSON"],[855,862,"PERSON"],[961,968,"PERSON"],[1205,1212,"PERSON"],[1229,1242,"PERSON"],[1245,1249,"PERSON"],[1318,1344,"PERSON"],[1353,1359,"PERSON"],[1366,1382,"PERSON"],[1385,1397,"PERSON"],[1447,1454,"PERSON"],[1468,1480,"PERSON"],[1485,1497,"PERSON"],[1685,1692,"PERSON"],[1717,1729,"PERSON"],[1763,1770,"PERSON"],[2018,2022,"PERSON"],[2024,2031,"PERSON"],[2209,2216,"PERSON"],[2340,2347,"PERSON"],[2516,2519,"INS"],[2704,2707,"INS"],[2887,2894,"PERSON"],[3030,3051,"INS"],[3071,3074,"INS"],[3113,3116,"INS"],[3208,3211,"INS"],[3344,3347,"INS"],[3567,3574,"PERSON"],[3655,3658,"INS"],[3713,3720,"PERSON"],[3798,3801,"INS"],[3926,3933,"PERSON"],[4028,4051,"STA"],[4067,4088,"RA"],[4585,4592,"PERSON"],[4664,4679,"CASE_NUM"],[4730,4737,"PERSON"],[4812,4816,"PERSON"],[4830,4845,"CASE_NUM"],[4905,4912,"PERSON"],[5070,5073,"INS"],[6438,6445,"PERSON"],[7396,7399,"INS"],[7450,7457,"PERSON"],[7717,7740,"STA"],[7791,7816,"INS"],[8317,8342,"INS"],[8344,8366,"INS"],[8372,8402,"INS"],[8476,8501,"INS"],[8503,8525,"INS"],[8530,8560,"INS"],[8579,8604,"INS"],[8606,8628,"INS"],[8633,8663,"INS"],[9682,9689,"PERSON"],[9840,9847,"PERSON"],[10021,10024,"INS"],[10295,10298,"INS"],[10890,10896,"STA"],[10993,11000,"PERSON"],[11346,11353,"PERSON"],[11491,11511,"INS"],[11516,11535,"CASE_NUM"],[11564,11571,"PERSON"],[11587,11593,"PERSON"],[11595,11602,"PERSON"],[11608,11617,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6036,"text":"Manila\nTHIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 254194, March 29, 2023 ]\nROSITA V. ZAMORA, PETITIONER, VS. RAMON BAGATSING, JR., ROSARITY L. BAGATSING, REYNALDO L. BAGATSING, AND MARILYN BAGATSING-­TOPACIO, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nGAERLAN, J.:\nAssailed in this Petition for Review on Certiorari are the Decision dated November 28, 2019 and the Resolution dated October 9, 2020 rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 111516, which reversed and set aside the Decision dated May 24, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasay City, Branch 118, in LRC Case No. R-PSY-16-24198-CV, which dismissed the petition for cancellation of annotation of adverse claim filed by respondents Ramon L. Bagatsing, Jr., Rosarity L. Bagatsing, Reynaldo L. Bagatsing, and Marilyn Bagatsing-Topacio (collectively, Bagatsings) against petitioner Rosita V. Zamora (Rosita).\nThe Facts\nThe present controversy involves a 439-square-meter parcel of land (subject property) located in Pasay City that was originally owned and registered under the names of spouses Rosita and Jesus Zamora (Jesus; collectively, spouses Zamora), as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 104125.\nHowever, as claimed by the Bagatsings, spouses Zamora, by virtue of a notarized Deed of Donation dated May 31, 1991, donated the subject property to Zenaida Lazaro (Lazaro), the mother of the former and the aunt of Rosita. On the basis of the said donation, TCT No. 141543 was issued in the name of Lazaro, thereby cancelling TCT No. 104125 in the name of spouses Zamora.\nRemarkably, Jesus died due to prostate cancer of even date to the execution of the said deed, around 2:00 a.m., at their house located at the subject property.\nAbout 24 years after, or specifically on March 13, 2015, Rosita filed an Affidavit of Adverse Claim for TCT No. 141543 on the ground of forgery, claiming that the signatures appearing on the purported Deed of Donation do not belong to her and her late husband, Jesus. The said filing caused the annotation on TCT No. 141543.\nSometime thereafter, Lazaro executed a Deed of Sale in favor of her children, the Bagatsings, who then registered the subject property in their names in a new certificate of title, TCT No. 003-2016000407, which carried with it the same annotation of adverse claim. The annotation prompted the Bagatsings to file a petition for cancellation of annotation of adverse claim with the RTC.\nFor her part, Rosita narrated that she and her husband, Jesus, took out a loan and mortgaged the subject property with L&R Corporation. Lazaro, who was Rosita's aunt, offered to pay the loan in order to cancel the mortgage and redeem the subject property. To effect the same, Lazaro asked for the owners' duplicate copy of TCT No. 104125 to which Rosita obliged. When Rosita went to the Register of Deeds to check on her title, as buyers became interested on the subject property, she learned that TCT No. 104125 has been cancelled and a new one has already been issued in the name of Lazaro.\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court\nThe RTC denied the petition for cancellation of annotation of adverse claim, the dispositive portion of the Decision dated May 24, 2018 reads:\nWHEREFORE, all the foregoing premises considered, the petitioner's prayer for cancellation of annotation of adverse claim is hereby DENIED .\nSO ORDERED.\nIn ruling so, the RTC found that the Deed of Donation supposedly executed by spouses Zamora in favor of Lazaro was a forgery, thus, prompting the Bagatsings to file an appeal before the CA.\nOn one hand, the Bagatsings asserted in their Appellants' Brief that the RTC erred in giving more evidentiary weight on the self-serving testimonies of Rosita. They also argued that Rosita was already barred by the Statute of Limitations, having asserted ownership only 24 years after the execution of the Deed of Donation.\nOn the other hand, Rosita contended that there was no reversible error on the part of the RTC when it gave more evidentiary weight on her evidence than that of the Bagatsings. She also alleged that the RTC did not err in failing to rule based on estoppel by laches and prescription.\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\nThe CA reversed and set aside the ruling of the RTC, thereby cancelling the adverse claim of Rosita. The dispositive portion of the November 28, 2019 Decision reads:\nACCORDINGLY, foregoing premises considered, the appeal is GRANTED . The Decision dated May 24, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasay City, Branch 118 in LTD Case No. R-PSY-16-24198-CV, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new one rendered CANCELLING THE ADVERSE CLAIM, annotated on TCT No. 003-2016000407 of the Registry of Deeds of Pasay City.\nSO ORDERED. (Emphases in the original)\nIn ruling for the Bagatsings, the CA found that the case was barred by prescription and laches. The CA ruled that the right of Rosita had already prescribed for failing to file an action for reconveyance within 10 years from the registration of the subject property in the name of Lazaro dated November 20, 1998. This is despite the CA finding that the signatures of spouses Zamora in the Deed of Donation were forged.\nConsequently, Rosita filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by the CA in a Resolution dated October 9, 2020, to wit:\nAccordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED .\nSO ORDERED. (Emphases in the original)\nAggrieved, Rosita filed the present recourse before the Court.\nIssues\nFor the resolution of this Court are the following issues:\nI. WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT A QUO COMMITTED AN ERROR IN LAW WHEN IT TACKLED MATTERS RELATING TO PRESCRIPTION OF AN ACTION FOR RECONVEYANCE IN AN APPEALED LAND REGISTRATION CASE; [AND]\nII. WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT A QUO COMMITTED AN ERROR IN LAW WHEN IT RULED THAT THE ACTION FOR RECONVEYANCE BASED ON AN INSTRUMENT WHOSE EXECUTION WAS FORGED HAD PRESCRIBED.\nThe Ruling of the Court\nThe Court grants the petition.\nI\nThe honorable court a quo did not commit an error in law when it tackled matters relating to prescription of an action for reconveyance in an appealed land registration case. 1aшphi1\nIn resolving the first issue, the Court underscores that among the matters raised by the Bagatsings in their Appellants' Brief before the court a quo was the issue on Statute of Limitations, with Rosita having asserted ownership only 24 years after the execution of the Deed of Donation. Thus, the court a quo was justified in tackling the same.\nNonetheless, it was erroneous for the CA to rule on the basis of prescription of an action for reconveyance. The Court stresses that the original action was a petition for cancellation of annotation of adverse claim filed by the Bagatsings. Tracing it further, what sparked this whole case was the Affidavit of Adverse Claim filed by Rosita. Yet, the court a quo resolved the case on the basis of the prescription of an action for reconveyance on the part of Rosita.\nAlthough an action for reconveyance and the annotation of adverse claim are both reliefs available to the rightful owner of the land which has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in the name of another, these two have different purposes. An action for reconveyance, on one hand, is for the purpose of compelling the transfer of the land to the rightful owner. On the other hand, the annotation of adverse claim is designed to protect the interest of a person over a real property by giving notice to third persons that there is a controversy over the ownership of the said property. Even more importantly, an action for reconveyance is an original action filed before the Regional Trial Courts or the Municipal Trial Courts, depending on the assessed value of the property involved, while an adverse claim is a type of involuntary dealing made through the filing of a sworn statement before the Register of Deeds.\nApplying the foregoing, the Court finds more reason to rule that an action for reconveyance is entirely different from a petition for cancellation of adverse claim, which is the original action in this case. In its very obvious sense, the former may be filed with or without an adverse claim annotated on the land title, while the latter cannot be filed without an adverse claim.\nTherefore, although the court a quo was justified in discussing prescription as it was one of the matters raised before it, a ruling on the basis of prescription of an action for reconveyance is unwarranted in this case.\nII\nThe honorable court a quo committed an error in law when it ruled that the action for reconveyance based on an instrument whose execution was forged had prescribed.\nStill ruling on prescription, the court a quo declared that the instant case was barred by prescription, having found that Rosita slept on her right to file an action for reconveyance within the 10-year period from the registration of the subject property in the name of Lazaro on November 20, 1998.\nAgain, at the risk of sounding repetitious, the appealed case was regarding the denied petition for cancellation of annotation of adverse claim, and not an action for reconveyance. Assuming arguendo that the case was an action for reconveyance, the Court finds that the same has not yet prescribed.\nIn Heirs of Arao v. 1aшphi1 Heirs of Eclipse, the Court earlier ruled that a complaint for cancellation of title based on the nullity of the Deed of Conveyance does not prescribe. Thus, it goes without saying that an action predicated on the fact that the conveyance complained of was null and void ab initio is, likewise, imprescriptible.\nApplying the foregoing points to the case at bar, Rosita's right to file an action for reconveyance does not prescribe, since, as aptly found by both the RTC and the court a quo, the signatures of spouses Zamora appearing on the Deed of Donation, from which the Bagatsings derive their title, were forged, making the conveyances made after the donation null and void.\nAs observed by the court a quo, there were distinct inconsistencies in the signature of Rosita as it appears on the Deed of Donation and on the Affidavit of Adverse Claim. The strokes of the signature found on the former are rounded and paused, whereas the signature on the latter appears to have thin and precise strokes. For the signature of her deceased husband, Jesus, the court a quo also found that the same was forged, based on the testimony of Rosita who was familiar with Jesus' signature based from documents that her husband executed when he was still alive in accordance with Section 22 of Rule 132 in the Rules of Evidence.\nThus, there is no doubt that the Deed of Donation is spurious and the signatures of the donors as they appear thereon are forged. As enunciated by the Court in a number of cases, a forged deed is a nullity and conveys no title. Henceforth, any and all transactions subsequent to the said donation, including the purported sale made by Lazaro to the Bagatsings, shall be, likewise, null and void. Therefore, an action for reconveyance predicated on these null and void conveyances shall be deemed imprescriptible. Additionally, being an imprescriptible right, laches cannot be set up to resist the enforcement of the same. Hence, as correctly argued by Rosita, the court a quo committed an error in law when it ruled that the action for reconveyance based on an instrument whose execution was forged had prescribed.\nApplying the above discussion to the instant case, the RTC is correct in denying the petition for cancellation of annotation of adverse claim filed by the Bagatsings. As fittingly argued by the Bagatsings, Rosita carries the burden of proof to show that her adverse claim over the subject property is meritorious. After a careful and thorough perusal of the records, the Court finds merit in Rosita's adverse claim, following the finding of forgery on the Deed of Donation from which the Bagatsings derive their title.\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is GRANTED . The Decision dated November 28, 2019 and the Resolution dated October 9, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 111516, ordering the cancellation of the Notice of Adverse Claim, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE .

GELICAMI, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nZALAMEDA, J.:\nBusinesses are allowed to suspend operations and to dismiss their employees. Aside from having just and authorized causes for termination of employment, however, suspensions of operations and dismissals of employees must be done in accordance with law. Otherwise, employers must bear the consequences for their non-compliance.\nThe Case\nThis is a Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by Keng Hua Paper Products Co., Inc. (Keng Hua) and its president, James Yu (Yu) (collectively, petitioners) assailing the Decision dated 30 September 2015 and the Resolution dated 11 April 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 124951.\nThe assailed Decision and Resolution reversed and set aside the Decision dated 06 February 2012 and the Resolution dated 26 March 2012 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which had affirmed in toto the Decision dated 28 October 2011 rendered by the Labor Arbiter dismissing the Complaint for Illegal Dismissal but awarding separation pay to Carlos E. Ainza (Ainza), Primo Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz), and Benjamin R. Gelicami (Gelicami) (collectively, respondents).\nAntecedents\nRespondents were employees of Keng Hua who filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with prayer for separation pay, underpayment of wages, damages, and attorney's fees on 31 March 2011.\nAinza was hired in July 1981 as a machine tender. Dela Cruz was hired in April 1982 but resigned on 26 March 2001 to avail of his gratuity pay. He was rehired in May 2001. Gelicami was hired in February 2002. Ainza and Dela Cruz's salaries amounted to P392. per day, while Gelicami's was P383. per day.\nSometime in January 2010, all respondents alleged, to wit:\n\"[They were] stopped at the gate and were bluntly told by [petitioners'] security guards, acting upon orders of [petitioners] that they had no more jobs to do. [Respondents] were not even allowed to talk to their superiors to at least hear the reason, if, there be any, of their abrupt termination. [Respondents] were dumbfounded to suddenly find themselves out of [work].\"\nPetitioners, on the other hand, claimed that there was no illegal dismissal because Keng Hua ceased operating and there was no work for respondents. Keng Hua is located at 1000 Gov. Pascual Avenue, Potrero, Malabon City, an area that was greatly affected by the flashfloods caused by typhoon Ondoy in late September 2009. The floods seriously damaged Keng Hua's equipment. Prior to typhoon Ondoy, Keng Hua was already suffering a decline in their income since 2007, as evidenced by the comparative income statements it submitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for the years 2006 to 2009 and 2011 to 2013. £A⩊phi£ Moreover, Samahan ng mga Manggawa sa Globe Keng Hua  Association Genuine Labor Union (union), the employees' union that counts respondents as members, recognized the effect of typhoon Ondoy on Keng Hua's income when it entered into a notarized agreement about their wages:\n1. Dahil sa tindi ng hagupit ng Bagyong Ondoy, halos isang daang Porsyento ng ari-arian ng Kompanya ay nawasak. Tulad ng mga makinarya ng papel, electronic sensor, motor speed control, transformers, power cables, atbp at nasunog ang isang bodega na may laman na hilaw na materyales ng papel at sumabog ang buong pasilidad ng CO2 Chemical Plant Recovery atbp. Dahil po sa malaking pinsala [na] ginawa ng Bagyong Ondoy, tumigil ang produkto[ng] kalakal ng [Keng Hua at] nagkasabay-sabay ang malas ay [sic] apektado ang kalagayang pinansyal ng [Keng Hua].\n2. Kaya, sa malungkot at mapait na pangyayaring ito, ang magkabilang panig, ang [Keng Hua] at ang mga pamunuan ng nagkakaisang manggagawa ay NAGKAKASUNDO, na ang kasalukuyang Wage Order No. 15 na, I PlNATUTUPAD NA, at ang kakulangang Back Wages, at ang implementasyon ng Wage Order No. 16, ay ipatutupad sa sandaling magnormalized [sic] na at bumalik ang dating operasyon ng gaming [sic] pagawaan.\n3. Na maliwanag din po sa kasunduang ito na ang tatanggap ng kakulangang Bayad o back wages sa nasabing Wage Order No. 15 at Wage Order No. 16 ay iyong lang pong pumasok o nagtrabaho sa mga nasabing araw na dapat bayaran, at ang NO WORK ay wala pong bayad (NO WORK-NO PAY policy).\nDespite petitioners' claim of cessation of operations, on 10 March 2011, two years after the occurrence of typhoon Ondoy, Keng Hua renewed its collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the union for the period covering 02 January 2011 to 02 January 2016. The existence of comparative income statements for 2011 to 2013 also shows that Keng Hua had operations beyond September 2009.\nRuling of the Labor Arbiter\nIn its Decision dated 28 October 2011, the Labor Arbiter (LA) ruled that the cause for the loss of respondents' jobs was not planned but was due to a fortuitous event. Cessation of operations to prevent losses is allowed under Article 283 of the Labor Code. Moreover, the CBA between petitioners and the union recognized the existence of petitioners' financial losses. Hence, there was no illegal dismissal. Nonetheless, the LA recognized that petitioners were willing to pay respondents' separation pay and ordered them to do so:\nWHEREFORE , premised on the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the complaint for illegal dismissal for lack of merit.\n[Petitioners] however are directed to pay [respondents] separation pay to wit:\n1. CARLOS AINZA  Php 221,108.\n2. PRIMO DELA CRUZ  Php 22,895.\n3. BENJAMIN GELICAME  Php 20,330.\nOther claims are DISMISSED .\nSO ORDERED.\nRuling of the NLRC\nRespondents sought the reversal of the ruling of the Labor Arbiter before the NLRC. In its Decision dated 06 February 2012, the NLRC denied respondents' appeal for lack of merit and affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision in toto.\nThe NLRC found that the factual circumstances brought about by typhoon Ondoy more than sufficiently substantiated and proved that respondents were not illegally dismissed from their employment. The NLRC was even \"fully convinced that there was no dismissal from the service in the first place.\"\nPetitioners' willingness to grant respondents their separation pay was also regarded in their favor. Likewise, the NLRC noted that the prevailing minimum wage at the time that respondents stopped working was only P362.. Therefore, petitioners' salaries were not underpaid.\nRespondents' motion for reconsideration was denied in a Resolution dated 26 March 2012.\nRuling of the CA\nRespondents filed a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 before the CA. They alleged that the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion in finding that they were not illegally retrenched by petitioners .\nIn its Decision dated 30 September 2015, the CA ruled in favor of respondents upon finding that they were retrenched and petitioners did not comply with the legal requirements for a valid retrenchment. Petitioners did not submit independently audited financial statements proving Keng Hua's alleged losses. Neither did petitioners serve written notices to respondents and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) at least one month prior to the date of retrenchment. There is also no showing that petitioners adopted other cost-saving measures before resorting to retrenchment. Petitioners did not use any fair and reasonable criteria to ascertain who would be retrenched. The CA ruled thus:\nWHEREFORE , the instant petition is GRANTED . The February 6, 2012 Decision and the subsequent March 26, 2012 Resolution of the NLRC is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE . Accordingly, a new judgment is entered declaring [respondents] to have been ILLEGALLY DISMISSED and ordering [petitioners] to REINSTATE them to their former position without loss of seniority rights and to pay their full backwages starting from their illegal dismissal in January 2010 until finality of this decision, or in the event reinstatement is no longer feasible, to pay [respondents] their full backwages, separation pay, and attorney's fees of ten percent (10%) of the total monetary awards.\nFor prompt execution hereof, this case is hereby remanded to the Labor Arbiter for the purpose of computing the exact amount of monetary award to each [respondent] pursuant to this decision.\nSO ORDERED.\nPetitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration which the CA denied for lack of merit in its Resolution dated 11 April 2016. In their motion, petitioners asserted that respondents were never prevented from reporting for work upon the resumption of Keng Hua's operations in May 2010.\nThe CA noted that petitioners now ascribe fault to respondents. In the CA's view, petitioners raised the issue of abandonment by respondents for the first time. The CA disallowed what it saw as petitioners' \"desperate attempt to evade liability\" and denied for lack of merit petitioners' motion for reconsideration in its Resolution dated 11 April 2016.\nIssues\nPetitioners raise two issues:\nI. Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals committed serious error in overturning the Decision and Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission thereby ruling that Respondents were illegally dismissed.\nII. Whether or not Petitioners raise abandonment as an issue for the first time in its Motion for Reconsideration.\nWe focus on the issue of illegal dismissal. The resolution of the issue of abandonment involves questions of facts which is not the domain of this Court.\nRuling of the Court\nThe petition has no merit. We affirm the CA's ruling and find petitioners liable for illegal dismissal.\nSix months: Length of a valid suspension\nKeng Hua ceased operations on 26 September 2009 and resumed only in May 2010. In their Petition, petitioners claim that \"[i]t was only on [15 May 2010], that [the company] slowly resumed its operation although not yet normal. Most employees likewise resumed their services with Petitioners except Respondents who had not returned from work since Petitioners temporarily stopped operation due to Ondoy.\" To further prove that there was no dismissal of respondents, on 10 September 2012, petitioners included respondents' names in the list of employees affected by its temporary closure due to heavy monsoon rains that they submitted to the DOLE field office. Prior to that date, however, respondents had already filed their complaint for illegal dismissal against petitioners.\nArticle 301 (formerly Article 286) of the Labor Code provides that the employee is reinstated to his former position when there is an indication that he desires to return to work one month from the resumption of his employer's operations after a bona fide suspension.\nArt. 301. When employment not deemed terminated.  The bona-fide suspension of the operation f a business or undertaking for a period not exceeding six (6) months, or the fulfillment by the employee of a military or civic duty shall not terminate employment. In all such cases, the employer shall reinstate the employee to his former position without loss of seniority rights if he indicates his desire to resume his work not later than one (1) month from the resumption of operations of his employer or from his relief from the military or civic duty.\nFurther, Article 301 of the Labor Code decreed that a suspension of operations will not lead to termination of employment if the suspension does not exceed six months. As the Court reiterated in Airborne Maintenance and Allied Services, Inc. v. Egos :\nThe suspension of employment under Article 301 of the Labor Code is only temporary and should not exceed six months, as the Court explained in PT & T Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission:\nx x x Article 286 [now Article 301 may be applied but only by analogy to set a specific period that employees may remain temporarily laid-off or in floating status. Six months is the period set by law that the operation of a business or undertaking may be suspended thereby suspending the employment of the employees concerned. The temporary lay-off wherein the employees likewise cease to work should also not last longer than six months. After six months, the employees should either be recalled to work or permanently retrenched following the requirements of the law, and that failing to comply with this would be tantamount to dismissing the employees and the employer would thus be liable for such dismissal.\nTemporary suspension of operations is recognized as a valid exercise of management prerogative provided it is not carried out in order to circumvent the provisions of the Labor Code or to defeat the rights of the employees under the Code.\nClearly, there is more than six months between the onslaught of typhoon Ondoy in September 2009 and the resumption of Keng Hua's operations in May 2010. Respondents filed their complaint for illegal dismissal on 31 March 2011. Petitioners never showed proof that they actually called respondents back to work on May 2010. They merely asserted that respondents were not prevented from coming to work in May 2010. Petitioners even admit that they \"have not recalled Respondents when the six-month period lapsed. To recall them with no work to do is simply illogical and would only drive Petitioners to even greater loss.\" Respondents' employment was thus terminated by operation of law because their work suspension extended beyond the statutory six-month period.\nCauses and requisites of a valid termination\nArticle 298 (formerly Article 283) of the Labor Code provides that an employment may be validly terminated due to retrenchment to prevent losses or the closing or cessation of business operations:\nArt. 283. Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel.  The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to the installation of labor-saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to prevent losses or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title, by serving a written notice on the workers and the Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended date thereof. In case of termination due to the installation of labor-saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least his one (1) month pay or to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1\/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year.\nIn Sanoh Fulton Phils., Inc. v. Bernardo, We explained Article 298 and emphasized that retrenchment to prevent losses or the closing or cessation of business operations do not compose one cause for termination of employment. Although they have the same procedural requirements, they have different causes and different requirements for validity, thus:\nRetrenchment to prevent losses and closure not due to serious business losses are two separate authorized causes for terminating the services of an employee. In J.A.T General Services v. NLRC, the Court took the occasion to draw the distinction between retrenchment and closure, to wit:\nClosure of business, on one hand, is the reversal of fortune of the employer whereby there is a complete cessation of business operations and\/or an actual locking-up of the doors of establishment, usually due to financial losses. Closure of business as an authorized cause for termination of employment aims to prevent further financial drain upon an employer who cannot pay anymore his employees since business has already stopped. On the other hand, retrenchment is reduction of personnel usually due to poor financial returns so as to cut down on costs of operations in terms of salaries and wages to prevent bankruptcy of the company. It is sometimes also referred to as down-sizing. Retrenchment is an authorized cause for termination of employment which the law accords an employer who is not making good in its operations in order to cut back on expenses for salaries and wages by laying off some employees. The purpose of retrenchment is to save a financially ailing business establishment from eventually collapsing.\nThe respective requirements to sustain their validity are likewise different.\nFor retrenchment, the three (3) basic requirements are: (a) proof that the retrenchment is necessary to prevent losses or impending losses; (b) service of written notices to the employees and to the Department of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month prior to the intended date of retrenchment; and (c) payment of separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay, or at least one-half (1\/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. In addition, jurisprudence has set the standards for losses which may justify retrenchment, thus:\n(1) the losses incurred are substantial and not de minimis; (2) the losses are actual or reasonably imminent; (3) the retrenchment is reasonably necessary and is likely to be effective in preventing the expected losses; and (4) the alleged losses, if already incurred, or the expected imminent losses sought to be forestalled, are proven by sufficient and convincing evidence.\nUpon the other hand, in termination, the law authorizes termination of employment due to business closure, regardless of the underlying reasons and motivations therefor, be it financial losses or not. However, to put a stamp to its validity, the closure\/cessation of business must be bona fide, i.e. , its purpose is to advance the interest of the employer and not to defeat or circumvent the rights of employees under the law or a valid agreement.\nIn termination cases either by retrenchment or closure, the burden of proving that the termination of services is for a valid or authorized cause rests upon the employer. Not every loss incurred or expected to be incurred by an employer can justify retrenchment. The employer must prove, among others, that the losses are substantial and that the retrenchment is reasonably necessary to avert such losses. And to repeat, in closures, the bona fides of the employer must be proven.\nA cursory reading of Article 298 will readily show that, regardless of cause, there are two procedural requirements for a valid termination of employment: (1) service of a written notice to the employees and to the DOLE at least one month before the intended date thereof; and (2) payment to the employees of termination pay amounting to one month pay or at least one-half month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. The Labor Code does not provide for exemptions from these two procedural requirements.\nPetitioners failed to show proof of compliance with the procedural requirements for a valid termination of employment. First, Keng Hua failed to show any proof of such written notice to any of the respondents or to the DOLE. That respondents were already on temporary lay-off at the time notice should have been given to them is not an excuse to forego the one-month written notice because by this time, their lay-off is to become permanent and they were definitely losing their employment. Second, Keng Hua failed to show proof of payment of termination pay to respondents.\nAccordingly, We rule against petitioners' claim of valid termination of respondents' employment based on cessation of operations. The facts simply do not support petitioners' claim.\nPetitioners provided the LA and the CA with the union's recognition in 2011 of Keng Hua's financial losses. Petitioners annexed to their petition copies of the comparative income statements that Keng Hua submitted to the BIR for the years 2006 to 2009 and 2011 to 2013. Be that as it may, We find it even more noteworthy that these income statements prove that Keng Hua was operating even four years after the occurrence of typhoon Ondoy. The records will show that neither the LA, the NLRC, nor the CA established the date of Keng Hua's actual cessation of operations.\nBecause of these, We cannot bring ourselves to rule that Keng Hua's closure, if there be one, is done in good faith, for to do so will defeat or circumvent respondents' rights under the law or a valid agreement.\nWe also rule against petitioners' claim that respondents were not dismissed. We agree with the CA's ruling that respondents were retrenched and petitioners did not comply with the requisites of a valid retrenchment. To effect a valid retrenchment, We added three substantive requirements to the two procedural requirements mentioned above:\nThe requirements for valid retrenchment which must be proved by clear and convincing evidence are: (1) that the retrenchment is reasonably necessary and likely to prevent business losses which, if already incurred, are not merely de minimis , but substantial, serious, actual and real, or if only expected, are reasonably imminent as perceived objectively and in good faith by the employer; (2) that the employer served written notice both to the employees and to the Department of Labor and Employment at least one month prior to the intended date of retrenchment; (3) that the employer pays the retrenched employees separation pay equivalent to one month pay or at least 1\/2 month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher; (4) that the employer exercises its prerogative to retrench employees in good faith for the advancement of its interest and not to defeat or circumvent the employees' right to security of tenure; and (5) that the employer used fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining who would be dismissed and who would be retained among the employees, such as status (i.e., whether they are temporary, casual, regular or managerial employees), efficiency, seniority, physical fitness, age, and financial hardship for certain workers.\nKeng Hua failed to show before the LA and the NLRC financial statements to prove its actual business losses. The CA even made a factual finding that \"there are no independent audited financial statements proving the alleged financial losses of [Keng Hua].\" There was also no showing that petitioners adopted other cost-saving measures before resorting to retrenchment. There was no indication that petitioners used fair and reasonable criteria, if at all, in determining who would be retrenched.\nWe distinguish between the effect of petitioners' failure to comply with the procedural requirements of a valid termination and the effect of petitioners' failure to establish the cause of a valid termination. 1âшphi1\nHere, petitioners failed to comply with the substantive requisites of a valid retrenchment. Consequently, respondents should receive the reliefs afforded to illegally dismissed employees mandated by Article 294 (formerly 279) of the Labor Code.\nArt. 294. Security of Tenure.  In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title. An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.\nSince respondents' termination was illegal, they are entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and to their full backwages pursuant to the said article. Reinstatement and payment of backwages, as the normal consequences of illegal dismissal, presuppose that the previous position from which the employee has been removed is still in existence or there is an unfilled position of a nature, more or less, similar to the one previously occupied by said employee.\nPetitioners stress that they are contesting \"the wisdom of reinstating [respondents] to their former positions when it is a fact that even to this day [petitioners] no longer have the capability to manufacture.\" Further, it has been more than a decade since the incident which have led to respondents' predicament and We recognize the probable change in petitioners' circumstances over time. For these two reasons, the disposition of the CA is modified. Given the circumstances of this case, an award of separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement, is justified.\nUnder Article 279 (now Article 294) of the Labor Code, backwages is computed from the time of dismissal until the employee's reinstatement. However, when separation pay is ordered in lieu of reinstatement, backwages is computed from the time of dismissal until the finality of the decision ordering separation pay. Anent the computation of separation pay, the same shall be equivalent to one month salary for every year of service and should not go beyond the date an employee was deemed to have been actually separated from employment, or beyond the date when reinstatement was rendered impossible. In the present case, in allowing separation pay, the final decision effectively declares that the employment relationship ended so that separation pay and backwages are to be computed up to that point.\nThe computation of the separation pay for each of the respondents should be based on one month's salary for every year of service. Ainza's employment began in July 1981, Dela Cruz in May 2001, and Gelicami in February 2002. The finality of this decision marks the end of respondents' employment relationship with petitioners, hence respondents' separation pay should be computed up to this point. The CA's award of attorney's fees is affirmed, in view of the fact that respondents were compelled to litigate and incur expenses to protect their rights and interests.\nWHEREFORE , the foregoing premises considered, the instant Petition is hereby DENIED . The assailed the Decision dated 30 September 2015 and Resolution dated 11 April 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 124951 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that petitioners Keng Hua Paper Products Co., Inc., and its President, James Yu, are solidarily liable to pay each of the respondents, namely, Carlos E. Ainza, Primo Dela Cruz, and Benjamin R. Gelicami the following: (1) separation pay computed from respondents' respective first day of employment until the finality of this Decision, at the rate of one month per year of service; and (2) attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total monetary award. The monetary awards also shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.\nThe case is REMANDED to the Labor Arbiter for the proper computation of the monetary benefits awarded.\nSO ORDERED.\nGesmundo, C.J., (Chairperson), Dimaampao, Marquez, and Kho, Jr., JJ., concur.\n","label":[[24,39,"CASE_NUM"],[41,58,"PROM_DATE"],[61,94,"INS"],[99,107,"PERSON"],[126,141,"PERSON"],[143,158,"PERSON"],[164,184,"PERSON"],[618,651,"INS"],[653,661,"INS"],[682,690,"PERSON"],[692,694,"PERSON"],[817,833,"INS"],[842,863,"CASE_NUM"],[1007,1042,"INS"],[1221,1236,"PERSON"],[1238,1243,"PERSON"],[1246,1261,"PERSON"],[1263,1272,"PERSON"],[1279,1299,"PERSON"],[1301,1309,"PERSON"],[1382,1390,"INS"],[1587,1596,"PERSON"],[1709,1717,"PERSON"],[1746,1751,"PERSON"],[1756,1765,"PERSON"],[1810,1818,"PERSON"],[2357,2365,"INS"],[2422,2430,"INS"],[2624,2632,"INS"],[2670,2678,"INS"],[2809,2835,"INS"],[2837,2840,"INS"],[2905,2980,"INS"],[2982,2987,"INS"],[3089,3097,"INS"],[3624,3632,"INS"],[3711,3719,"INS"],[3803,3811,"INS"],[3993,4010,"STA"],[4224,4241,"STA"],[4245,4262,"STA"],[4523,4531,"INS"],[4737,4745,"INS"],[4855,4868,"INS"],[4870,4872,"INS"],[5058,5068,"STA"],[5573,5585,"PERSON"],[5604,5619,"PERSON"],[5637,5654,"PERSON"],[5724,5728,"INS"],[5782,5795,"INS"],[5807,5811,"INS"],[5924,5937,"INS"],[5962,5966,"INS"],[6156,6160,"INS"],[6368,6372,"INS"],[6628,6630,"INS"],[6712,6714,"INS"],[6738,6742,"INS"],[6893,6895,"INS"],[7128,7136,"INS"],[7224,7258,"INS"],[7260,7264,"INS"],[7530,7532,"INS"],[7673,7677,"INS"],[8474,8476,"INS"],[8664,8672,"INS"],[8703,8705,"INS"],[8770,8772,"INS"],[8864,8866,"INS"],[9122,9138,"INS"],[9213,9248,"INS"],[9637,9640,"INS"],[9741,9749,"INS"],[10380,10384,"INS"],[10559,10569,"STA"],[11366,11376,"STA"],[11533,11579,"INS"],[11644,11654,"STA"],[11733,11745,"INS"],[11749,11784,"INS"],[13588,13598,"STA"],[14176,14208,"INS"],[14954,14979,"INS"],[14983,14991,"PERSON"],[15464,15486,"INS"],[15490,15494,"INS"],[18987,18997,"STA"],[19196,19204,"INS"],[19289,19293,"INS"],[19569,19577,"INS"],[19852,19854,"INS"],[19863,19865,"INS"],[19906,19914,"INS"],[20022,20030,"INS"],[20048,20051,"INS"],[20188,20196,"INS"],[20305,20307,"INS"],[20313,20317,"INS"],[20327,20329,"INS"],[20354,20362,"INS"],[20454,20462,"INS"],[20704,20706,"INS"],[21417,21451,"INS"],[22243,22245,"INS"],[22254,22258,"INS"],[22321,22323,"INS"],[22453,22461,"INS"],[23155,23165,"STA"],[23177,23195,"INS"],[24615,24617,"INS"],[24780,24790,"STA"],[25670,25675,"PERSON"],[25709,25718,"PERSON"],[25736,25744,"PERSON"],[25940,25942,"INS"],[26284,26300,"INS"],[26304,26325,"CASE_NUM"],[26377,26410,"INS"],[26431,26439,"PERSON"],[26503,26518,"PERSON"],[26520,26535,"PERSON"],[26541,26561,"PERSON"],[27071,27079,"PERSON"],[27102,27111,"PERSON"],[27113,27120,"PERSON"],[27126,27129,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nDIMAAMPAO, J.:\nChallenged in this Petition for Review on Certiorari are the Decision and the Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sitting en banc, which upheld the deficiency tax assessments issued against Mannasoft Technology Corporation (petitioner) for calendar year 2008 owing to its failure to timely file a petition for review within the reglementary period provided by law, and which denied the Motion for Reconsideration thereof, respectively, in CTA EB No. 1637.\nThe factual backdrop of this case is uncomplicated.\nPursuant to Letter of Authority No. 00042459, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (respondent), through its duly authorized revenue officers, conducted a tax investigation on petitioner for calendar year 2008.\nRespondent then issued a Notice of Informal Conference (NIC) and Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN), which was purportedly personally served upon petitioner through a certain \"Ms. Gladys Badocdoc,\" whose indicated position was \"Client Service Assistant.''\nEventually, respondent issued a Formal Assessment Notice (FAN) on November 16, 2011, finding petitioner liable for deficiency income tax in the amount of P13,475,472., deficiency value-added tax (VAT) amounting to P57,102,109., and expanded withholding tax (EWT) of ₱8,212,654.. The parties stipulated that the FAN was personally served upon a certain \"Angelo Pineda,\" who was petitioner's reliever security guard at that time.\nPetitioner filed its protest to the FAN on December 22, 2011, while its supporting documents were submitted on February 20, 2012. Despite this, respondent wrote petitioner that it had yet to submit its records to support its protest. Consequently, respondent issued on October 23, 2012 a Warrant of Distraint and\/or Levy (WDL) against petitioner. On October 29, 2012, petitioner again protested the WDL for being premature since the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) had not yet evaluated the documents it had submitted.\nOn November 13, 2012, petitioner requested anew for the reinvestigation of its case, but this was rejected by the BIR via a letter-reply, which was received by petitioner on November 25, 2013. In the same letter, the BIR declared that this was its \"final decision on the matter,\" and that petitioner had 30 days from receipt thereof to pay the deficiency taxes, otherwise the BIR would enforce collection through summary remedies.\nAccordingly, petitioner filed on December 10, 2013 a Petition for Review before the CTA. Pre-trial, followed by the trial proper, then ensued.\nPetitioner argued, inter alia, that the assessment notices and the WDL were void because: (1) its right to due process was violated as it never received the NIC and the PAN; (2) the FAN failed to state the facts and the law on which the assessment was based; (3) respondent failed to evaluate the documents it submitted in support of its protest; (4) both the FAN and the WDL were not received by petitioner's duly authorized officer; and (5) some of the assessed deficiency VAT and EWT had already prescribed. Petitioner then presented documentary and testimonial evidence in support of its arguments.\nFor its part, respondent countered that the assessment notices were made and issued in accordance with law, and applicable rules and regulations, and that the same were issued within the prescriptive period under the law.\nRuling of the Court of Tax Appeals\nThe CTA Third Division rendered a Decision granting the petition and ordering the cancellation of the assessment notices and the WDL. Preliminarily, it properly took cognizance of the case under its \"other matters\" jurisdiction pursuant to Section 7(a)(1) of Republic Act (RA) No. 1125, as amended by RA No. 9282. It also held that the NIC, the PAN, and the FAN were void for failing to comply with the due process requirements under the law and Revenue Regulations No. 12-99. It decreed that the assessment notices were served upon individuals other than the taxpayer's authorized representatives, hence, it cannot constitute receipt by the taxpayer. The fact that petitioner was able to protest the FAN did not cure the violation to petitioner's right to due process. Necessarily, the void assessment also rendered the WDL invalid.\nRespondent's motion for reconsideration of the foregoing Decision having been rebuffed by the CTA Third Division, it sought recourse before the CTA En Banc through a petition for review.\nRuling of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc\nIn the impugned Decision, the CTA En Banc granted respondent's appeal, thereby reversing and setting aside the assailed rulings of its Third Division. It held that in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, the proper reckoning point to invoke the jurisdiction of the tax court was from petitioner's receipt of the WDL. Considering that petitioner failed to seek judicial relief within the 30-day period provided by law, the WDL attained finality which, in turn, deprived the CTA of jurisdiction to act on petitioner's original petition for review. Resultantly, petitioner was ordered to pay the assessed deficiency taxes, inclusive of deficiency and delinquency interest.\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied in the disputed Resolution. The CTA En Banc further elucidated that before the tax court may pass upon the correctness and validity of the WDL and underlying assessment, it was incumbent upon petitioner to have first filed its appeal thereto within the period fixed by law, which it failed to do.\nAggrieved, petitioner instituted the present Petition before this Court.\nIssues\nThe issues tendered for the Court's resolution are whether the CTA En Banc erred in: (1) giving a restrictive interpretation to the \"other matters\" jurisdiction of the tax court under Section 7(a)(1) of RA No. 1125, as amended, as pertaining only to the receipt of the WDL and nothing more; and (2) disregarding the void assessment rendered by the respondent.\nTHE COURT'S RULING\nThe Petition is meritorious.\nAt the outset, it bears to point out that petitioner's framing of the first issue is wholly misleading as the assailed Decision did not at all give a restrictive interpretation to the \"other matters\" jurisdiction of the CTA. Rather, the tax court merely applied what it perceived to be the applicable jurisprudence to the facts in this case. In sooth, the essence of the first issue raised by petitioner is whether the CTA properly acquired jurisdiction over the present controversy. As restated, the Court is tasked to determine whether petitioner timely filed its Petition for Review before the CTA Third Division. Related thereto is the resolution of whether the proper reckoning point for the commencement of the 30-day period provided under Section 228 of RA No. 8424 (Tax Code) should be from petitioner's receipt of the WDL or from its receipt of the BIR's letter-reply denying its request for reinvestigation.\nThe Petition for Review before the CTA Third Division was timely filed within the reglementary period provided by law.\nSection 228 of the Tax Code governs the protest of assessments for deficiency taxes:\nSECTION 228. Protesting of Assessment. When the Commissioner or his duly authorized representative finds that proper taxes should be assessed, he shall first notify the taxpayer of his findings: Provided, however, That a preassessment notice shall not be required in the following cases:\nx x x x\nThe taxpayers shall be informed in writing of the law and the facts on which the assessment is made; otherwise, the assessment shall be void.\nWithin a period to be prescribed by implementing rules and regulations, the taxpayer shall be required to respond to said notice. ℒαwρhi৷ If the taxpayer fails to respond, the Commissioner or his duly authorized representative shall issue an assessment based on his findings.\nSuch assessment may be protested administratively by filing a request for reconsideration or reinvestigation within thirty (30) days from receipt of the assessment in such form and manner as may be prescribed by implementing rules and regulations. Within sixty (60) days from filing of the protest, all relevant supporting documents shall have been submitted; otherwise, the assessment shall become final.\nIf the protest is denied in whole or in part, or is not acted upon within one hundred eighty (180) days from submission of documents, the taxpayer adversely affected by the decision or inaction may appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals within thirty (30) days from receipt of the said decision, or from the lapse of the one hundred eighty (180)-day period; otherwise, the decision shall become final, executory and demandable.\nAs may be gleaned from the foregoing, when a taxpayer protests the FAN issued by respondent, the latter has 180 days from receipt of the relevant supporting documents within which to act on the former's request for reconsideration or reinvestigation. After the lapse of the 180-day period, or from the denial of the protest, whichever is earlier, the taxpayer must appeal the same to the CTA. However, jurisprudence has also recognized an alternative recourse in case of respondent's inaction to a protest. In Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (RCBC), as recently reiterated in Light Rail Transit Authority v. Bureau of Internal Revenue ( LRTA case ), the taxpayer may either:\n(1) file a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals within 30 days after the expiration of the 180-day period fixed by law for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to act on the disputed assessment; or\n(2) await the final decision of the Commissioner on the disputed assessments and appeal such final decision to the Court of Tax Appeals within 30 days after receipt of a copy of such decision. This is true even if the 180-day period for the Commissioner to act on the disputed assessment had already expired.\nThe two options are mutually exclusive and resort to one bars the other. This is also consistent with Section 3(a)(2), Rule 4 of A.M. No. 05- 11-07-CTA, or the Revised Rules of the Court of Tax Appeals, which states that \"should the taxpayer opt to await the final decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the disputed assessments beyond the one hundred eighty day-period abovementioned, the taxpayer may appeal such final decision to the Court under Section 3(a), Rule 8 of these Rules.\"\nAs adumbrated above, petitioner timely filed its protest to the FAN and submitted its supporting documents thereto on February 20, 2012. From this date, the 180-day period began to run. Undoubtedly, when respondent issued the WDL on October 23, 2012, the 180-day period had already lapsed. Nonetheless, petitioner's immediate letter-protest to the WDL on October 29, 2012 made it perfectly clear that it was awaiting respondent's action on its request for reinvestigation. This is an express indication that petitioner was opting for the second recourse provided in RCBC in response to respondent's inaction to its protest. This is again apparent in petitioner's subsequent letter dated November 13, 2012, which reiterated its appeal for reinvestigation.\nWhen respondent finally replied to petitioner in the letter dated November 14, 2013, denying its request for reinvestigation, the response constituted the final decision on the disputed assessment, which was appealable to the CTA in accordance with the remedies espoused in RCBC. It is not amiss to add that in actual fact, the letter-reply explicitly stated that it \" constitutes [the BIR's] final decision on the matter. \"\nThe Court is mindful of certain cases where it held that the issuance of the WDL constitutes constructive and final denial to the taxpayer's protest, which would trigger the running of the 30-day period to elevate the case to the CTA. This is the doctrine laid down in Philippine Journalists, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue ( PJI case ), which was cited by both the CTA Third Division and En Banc. However, as will be explained below, the ruling in the said case rests on different grounds.\nThe LRTA case is particularly instructive:\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue v. Isabela Cultural Corporation cannot be made basis to claim that the Final Notice Before Seizure is the final decision on the protest appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals. When Isabela was promulgated in 2001, Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125 had yet to be amended by Republic Act No. 9282 to add inactions of the Commissioner as appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals. Moreover, this Court had yet to promulgate Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation and Lascona, where it was clarified that taxpayers have the option to await the decision of the Commissioner in protests of disputed assessments before they file an appeal with the Court of Tax Appeals. In other words, in Isabela, the taxpayer still had no choice of awaiting the decision of the Commissioner on its protest. This is why in Isabela, this Court considered the Final Notice Before Seizure as the Commissioner's decision on the protest. More so because it was the only response Isabela Cultural Corporation received from the Commissioner after it had filed its protest. (Emphasis supplied)\nAppositely, the PJI case was also promulgated prior to the passage of RA No. 9282, which recognized inactions of the respondent as appealable to the CTA. Thus, the CTA En Banc erred in relying on this particular jurisprudence to buttress its dismissal of petitioner's case.\nIt should also be emphasized that availing of the summary collection remedies under the Tax Code, such as the issuance of a WDL, are premised first and foremost on the existence of \"delinquent taxes.\" This premise is lacking when the matter of the taxpayer's civil liability is subject of a valid request for reinvestigation which is still pending resolution by the respondent and its authorized agents, as in the case at bench.\nIn synthesis, the CTA properly took cognizance of petitioner's original petition for review. 1aшphi1\nThe assessment notices, and, by extension, the WDL, are void for violating petitioner's right to due process.\nAs to the second issue raised, petitioner delves into the actual validity of the assessment notices based on its alleged non-receipt of the NIC, the PAN, and the FAN.\nOn this score, it should be stressed that whether or not respondent validly served the assessment notice to petitioner in order to comply with the basic requirements of due process is a question of fact that is normally beyond the purview of petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. Indeed, it is not the Court's duty to once again analyze or weigh evidence that has already been duly considered by the lower courts. The Court of Tax Appeal's findings can only be disturbed on appeal if they are not supported by substantial evidence, or there is a showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the tax court.\nInterestingly, the CTA En Banc mainly focused on the timeliness of petitioner's resort to judicial recourse and did not reverse the factual finding of its Third Division that respondent failed to properly serve the assessment notices upon petitioner in the challenged rulings. Moreover, a thorough review of the pronouncements of the CTA Third Division reveals that its findings were adequately supported by substantial evidence.\nIn any event, even if the Court takes a second look at the facts of the case, it will still arrive at the same conclusion.\nIt is undisputed that the NIC, the PAN, and the FAN bear indications that they were personally served. However, those who received them were not authorized representatives of petitioner. To recall, the NIC and the PAN appeared to have been served upon one \"Ms. Gladys Badocdoc,\" whose indicated position was \"Client Service Assistant.\" The FAN, on the other hand, was personally served upon a certain \"Angelo Pineda,\" who was a reliever security guard at that time, and who was not even an employee of petitioner.\nSection 228 of the Tax Code explicitly provides that when the respondent finds that proper taxes should be assessed, the taxpayer must be properly notified of its findings. Moreover, under Section 3.. of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99, personal delivery must be acknowledged by the taxpayer or his duly authorized representative, viz. :\nSECTION 3. Due Process Requirement in the Issuance of a Deficiency Tax Assessment. \nx x x x\n3.. Formal Letter of Demand and Assessment Notice. - The formal letter of demand and assessment notice shall be issued by the Commissioner or his duly authorized representative. The letter of demand calling for payment of the taxpayer's deficiency tax or taxes shall state the facts, the law, rules and regulations, or jurisprudence on which the assessment is based, otherwise, the formal letter of demand and assessment notice shall be void (see illustration in ANNEX B hereof). The same shall be sent to the taxpayer only by registered mail or by personal delivery. If sent by personal delivery, the taxpayer or his duly authorized representative shall acknowledge receipt thereof in the duplicate copy of the letter of demand, showing the following: (a) His name; (b) signature; (c) designation and authority to act for and in behalf of the taxpayer, if acknowledged received by a person other than the taxpayer himself; and (d) date of receipt thereof. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe very same provision even requires that the signee-recipient must indicate their \"designation and authority to act for and in behalf of the taxpayer,\" which further emphasizes that personal delivery must be discriminate.\nThe wisdom for such a requirement is readily apparent  unless the recipient possesses a certain degree of authority or discretion, they would be unable to grasp the gravity of the service of an assessment notice and the potential financial impact it would have to the taxpayer they purport to serve and represent. This is especially true for juridical entity taxpayers who can only act through its officers and employees, and who would otherwise be prejudiced by such recipient's simple ignorance.\nWhile Sections 3... and 3... of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99, which govern the NIC and the PAN, respectively, bear no similar qualifications for personal delivery as those found under Section 3.., the Court deems it more in keeping with the spirit of the law that these should likewise be served only upon the taxpayer or, especially for juridical entities, their duly authorized representatives.\nThis is consistent with the oft-repeated principle that the sending and actual receipt of the PAN is part and parcel of the due process requirement in the issuance of a deficiency tax assessment that the BIR must strictly comply with. Certainly, the importance of this preliminary stage of the assessment process cannot be discounted as it presents an opportunity for both the taxpayer and the BIR to settle the case at the earliest possible time without need for the issuance of a FAN.\nHaving failed to properly serve petitioner with the NIC and the PAN, it necessarily follows that the succeeding FAN was void and without effect.\nAssuming arguendo that the Court applied a strictly plain reading of the requirements laid down in Sections 3... and 3... and validate the receipt thereof by petitioner's receptionist the service of the FAN remains glaringly problematic.\nThe parties stipulated that the FAN was personally served upon Mr. Angelo Pineda, who, at that time, was merely the reliever security guard at petitioner's premises. However, as astutely observed by the CTA Third Division in its Resolution dated March 16, 2017, the stamp receipt found on the FAN shows that there was no indication of his authority to act on behalf of petitioner, contrary to the clear requirement under Section 3.. of Revenue Regulations No. 12-99. The fact that Angelo Pineda is not even an employee of petitioner serves to further exacerbate his lack of authority to represent the corporation.\nNotably, this defect in complying with the requirements of due process was not cured by the fact that the taxpayer was able to file a protest to the FAN. This Court has repeatedly enjoined strict observance by the BIR of the prescribed procedure for issuance of the assessment notices in order to uphold the taxpayers' constitutional rights.\nWell-settled is the rule that an assessment that fails to strictly comply with the due process requirements set forth in Section 228 of the Tax Code and Revenue Regulations No. 12-99 is void and produces no effect.

The assailed Review and Recommendation dated August 6, 1998 of Graft Investigation Officer Emora C. Pagunuran, and approved by Ombudsman Aniano A.

In addition, respondent Cojuangco, Jr. filed a Motion for Reconsideration of this Court's August 23, 2001 Decision.\nOn July 7, 2004, this Court issued a Resolution:(a) setting aside Our August 23, 2001 Decision as the case was not yet ripe for decision; and (b) directing the petitioner Republic to serve copies of the petition on all the respondents. As to Cojuangco, Jr.'s Motion for Reconsideration, the same was rendered moot by this Court, to wit:\nWHEREFORE, the decision of the Court dated August 23, 2001 isSET ASIDE. The petitioner is DIRECTED to serve copies of the petition on the respondents who are directed to file their respective Comments on the petition within ten (10) days from said service. The motion for reconsideration of respondent Eduardo Cojuangco is MOOTED by the resolution of this Court.\nSO ORDERED.\nThereafter, the Ombudsman and petitioner Republic filed their respective Motion for Reconsideration,and Motion for Partial Reconsideration.Subsequently, this Court issued a Resolution dated March 19, 2008 denying with finality the respective motions for lack of merit.\nHence, respondents filed their respective Comments to Republic's Petition under Rule 65, namely: (a) respondent Concepcion's Commentdated August 27, 2004; (b) respondent Dela Cuesta's Commentdated August 11 2008; and (c) respondents Ursua and Pineda's Commentsdated April 13, 2009 Meanwhile, this Court noted respondent Enrile's Commentdated May 6, 1999.\nAs to respondents Eleazar, Jr., Orosa, Lobregat, and Cojuangco, Jr., they were excluded as respondents of this criminal case in view of their deaths on December 10, 2000, September 18, 2002, January 2, 2004, and June 16, 2020, respectively.The demise of respondents Eleazar, Jr., Orosa, Lobregat, and Cojuangco, Jr. prior to final judgment terminates their criminal liabilitywithout prejudice to the right of the State to recover unlawfully acquired properties or ill-gotten wealth, if any.\nBackground of the Case\nSometime in 1972, Agricultural Investors, Inc. (AII), a private corporation owned and\/or controlled by respondent Cojuangco, Jr., allegedly started developing a coconut seed garden in Bugsuk Island, Palawan.\nThereafter, on November 14, 1974, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. (PD) 582,which created the Coconut Industry Development Fund (CIDF). CIDF is a permanent fund which shall be deposited with, and administered and utilized by the Philippine National Bank (PNB) through its subsidiary, the National Investment and Development Corporation (NIDC), with the following purposes:\na) To finance the establishment, operation and maintenance of a hybrid coconut seednut farm under such terms and conditions that may be negotiated by the National Investment and Development Corporation with any private person, corporation, firm or entity as would insure that the country shall have, at the earliest possible time, a proper, adequate and continuous supply of high yielding hybrid seednuts;\nb) To purchase all of the seednuts produced by the hybrid coconut seednut farm which shall be distributed, for free, by the Authority to coconut farmers in accordance with, and in the manner prescribed in, the nationwide coconut replanting program that it shall devise and implement;Provided,That farmers who have been paying the levy herein authorized shall be given priority;\nc) To finance the establishment, operation and maintenance of extension services, model plantations and other activities as would insure that the coconut farmers shall be informed of the proper methods of replanting their farms with the hybrid seednuts.\n\"The CIDF was envisioned to finance a nationwide coconut-replanting program using 'precocious high-yielding hybrid seednuts' to be distributed for free to coconut farmers. Its initial capital of PHP 100,000,000.00 was to be paid from the Coconut Consumers Stabilization Fund (CCSF), with an additional amount of at least P0.20 per kilogram of copra resecada out of the CCSF collected by the Philippine Coconut Authority.\"\nOn November 20, 1974 or six days after the creation of CIDF, NIDC accepted AII's offer, and contracted the latter's services to implement the vital purpose of PD 582, i.e., to produce precocious high-yielding hybrid seednuts.Thus, NIDC, represented by its then Senior Vice-President, respondent Orosa, and AII, represented by its then Chairman and President, respondent Cojuangco, Jr., entered into and executed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)on November 20, 1974. A series of supplemental agreements and amendments subsequent to the MOA dated November 20, 1974 were likewise executed on June 27, 1975, September 10, 1977, April 12, 1979, and September 18, 1980, respectively.\nThe MOA dated November 20, 1974 principally provides that AII shall develop its coconut seed garden in Bugsuk Island, Palawan to produce high-yielding hybrid seednuts, and thereafter, sell its entire produce to NIDC.On the other hand, NIDC obligated itself to pay AII the cost of the establishment, operation and maintenance of the seed garden, and support facilities; and to buy AII's entire production of high-yielding hybrid seednuts.\nHowever, on June 11, 1978, then President Marcos issued PD 1468,otherwise known as theRevised Coconut Industry Code, which created the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA). PCA was tasked to implement and attain the State's policy \"to promote the rapid integrated development and growth of the coconut and other palm oil industry in all its aspects, and to ensure that the coconut farmers become direct participants in, and beneficiaries of, such development and growth.\"\nAs per Article III, Section 3 of PD 1468, the CIDF shall be administered and utilized by the bank acquired for the benefit of the coconut farmers under PD 755Correspondingly, United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB), a commercial bank whose then President was respondent Cojuangco, Jr., was acquired by the government through the CCSF for the benefit of the coconut farmers.As a result, NIDC was substituted by UCPB as the administrator-trustee of the CIDF, and as a party to the MOA dated November 20, 1974 with AII, and its supplements and amendments.\nHowever, on August 27, 1982, President Marcos lifted the CCSF levy which resulted in the depletion of the CIDF.With no financial source UCPB terminated its MOA dated November 20, 1974 with AII, and its supplements and amendments, effective December 31, 1982.\nAggrieved, AII demanded arbitration as per the arbitration clause provided in the MOA dated November 20, 1974.Accordingly, the Board of Arbitrators (BOA), composed of Atty. Esteban Bautista, Atty. Aniceto Dideles, and Atty. Bartolome Carale, was created to settle AII and UCPB's obligations by reason of the termination of the MOA dated November 20, 1974, and its supplements and amendments.\nOn March 29, 1983, the BOA rendered its Decision in favor of AII and awarded the latter liquidated damages amounting to PHP 958,650,000.00 from the CIDF. \"From this award was deducted the [amount of PHP 426,261,640.00advanced by the NIDC for the development of the seed garden, leaving a balance due to AII amounting to [PHP 532,388,354.00.\"In addition, the BOA ordered that the costs of arbitration and the arbitrator's fee of PHP 150,000.00 be paid out from the CIDF.\n\"On April 19, 1983, the UCPB Board of Directors, composed of respondents Cojuangco, Jr. as President, Enrile as Chairman, Dela Cuesta, Zayco, Ursua and Pineda as members, adopted Resolution No. 111-83, resolving to 'note' the decision of the Board of Arbitrators, allowing the arbitral award to lapse with finality.\"\nThereafter, on February 12, 1990, petitioner Republic filed the subject Complaint against respondents Cojuangco, Jr., Enrile, Lobregat, Dela Cuesta, Eleazar, Jr., Concepcion, Ursua, Pineda and Orosa.\nPetitioner Republic's Complaint (OMB-0-90-2808)\nRepublic averred that respondent Cojuangco, Jr. took advantage of his close relationship with then President Marcos for his own personal and business interests through the issuance of favorable decrees.Cojuangco, Jr. caused the Philippine Government, through the NIDC, to enter into a contract with him, through its corporation AII, under terms and conditions grossly disadvantageous to the government and in conspiracy with the members of the UCPB Board of Directors, in flagrant breach of fiduciary duty as administrator-trustee of the CIDF.\nSpecifically, petitioner Republic averred that the MOA dated November 20, 1974 is a one-sided contract with provisions clearly in favor of AII, and thereby allegedly placed NIDC in a no-win situation.Petitioner cited several stipulations in the MOA dated November 20, 1974 to substantiate its claim, to wit:\n1. Under Section 9.1 of the MOA, neither party shall be liable for any loss or damage due to the non-performance of their respective obligations resulting from any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party concerned. However, under Section 9.3, notwithstanding the occurrence of such causes, the obligation of the NIDC to pay AII's share of the development costs amounting to PHP 426,260,000.00 would still remain enforceable.£A⩊phi£\n2. Under Sec. 11.2, if NIDC fails to perform its obligations, for any cause whatsoever, it will be liable out of the CIDF, not only for the development costs, but also for liquidated damages equal to the stipulated price of the hybrid seednuts for a period of five years at the rate of 19,173,000 seednutsper annum, totaling PHP 958,650.00.\n3. Under Section 11.3, while AII was given the right to terminate the contract in case offorce majeure, no such right was given in favor of NIDC. Moreover, AII can do so without incurring any liability for damages.\n4. AII was only required to exert best efforts to produce a projected number of seednuts while NIDC was required to set aside and reserve from CIDF such amount as would insure full and prompt payment.\nAs to respondents Enrile, Dela Cuesta, Concepcion, Ursua, and Pineda, petitioner Republic averred that as members of the UCPB Board of Directors, their act of allowing the BOA's March 29, 1983's Decision to lapse into finality resulted in the successful siphoning of PHP 840,789,855.33 from CIDF to AII a corporation owned by respondent Cojuangco, Jr. Thus, respondents as members and officers of UCPB, a government-owned and controlled corporation having been acquired by the government through the CCSF levy, are considered public officers within the contemplation of RA 3019. Furthermore, respondent Cojuangco, Jr. is considered a public officer being then the Director of PCA, the President of UCPB, and ambassador-at-large.\nPetitioner Republic further noted respondents Enrile, Cojuangco, Jr., Dela Cuesta, and Concepcion's respective positions as Chairman\/Director, President\/Director, Corporate Secretary, and Treasurer\/Director of AII until their resignation on November 8, 1982, as well as respondent Orosa's participation as Senior Vice-President of NIDC and the latter's representative to the execution of the MOA dated November 20, 1974.\nPetitioner Republic essentially professed that respondents are directly or indirectly interested in personal gain, or had material interest in the transaction requiring the approval of a board, panel, or group in which they were members, in violation of RA 3019 to the grave damage and prejudice of the public interest, the Filipino people, the Republic, and the coconut farmers.\nDecision of the Ombudsman (OMB-0-90-2808)\nOn August 6, 1998, GIO I Pagunuran issued a Review and Recommendation, which was approved by Ombudsman Desierto on August 14, 1998, dismissing petitioner Republic's Complaint against respondents on the ground of prescription.The Ombudsman reckoned the prescriptive period from the execution of the MOA on November 20, 1974. Since the case was filed only on February 12, 1990, the Ombudsman ruled that the same was filed beyond the prescriptive period of 10 years under Sec. 11 of RA 3019.Also, the Ombudsman declared that the MOA dated November 20, 1974 was confirmed and ratified by PD 961 and PD 1468 and therefore, was given legislative imprimatur, to wit:\nIt appears, therefore, that the execution of the questioned contracts and substitution of the NIDC by the UCPB were given legislative imprimatur. The ratification of the question[ed] MOA, its amendments and supplements by P.D. Nos. 961 and 1468 was, at the very least, a declaration on the part of the government that the questioned contracts are, in fact, valid, legal and beneficial to the government and the Republic and that the act of the officers of the NIDC of entering into the questioned contracts were, in fact valid and legal. The said laws have not been repealed nor declared constitutional and, therefore, remain valid and effective to date. Respondents, are therefore, protected by the mantle of legality which all valid laws cast upon those who abide by them.\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully recommended that the complaint be, as it is hereby, dismissed.(Emphasis supplied)\nPetitioner Republic filed its Motion for Reconsiderationon the following grounds: (a) the offense charged in the Complaint falls within the category of an ill-gotten wealth case, which under the Constitution is imprescriptible; and (b) void contracts are not subject to ratification and\/or confirmation. However, the said motion was denied by GIO I Pagunuran in the Order dated September 25, 1998, which was approved by Ombudsman Desierto on October 9, 1998.\nHence, this Petition under Rule 65.\nIssues\nPetitioner Republic presented the following issues for Our resolution:\nI.\nWHETHER THE OMBUDSMAN ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN DECLARING THAT THE OFFENSE CHARGED IN THE COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF R.A. NO. 3019 HAD ALREADY PRESCRIBED WHEN THE COMPLAINT WAS FILED.\nII.\nWHETHER THE OMBUDSMAN ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN DECLARING THAT THERE IS NO BASIS TO INDICT PRIVATE RESPONDENTS FOR VIOLATION OF THE ANTI-GRAFT LAW BASED ON THE CONTRACT IN QUESTION.\nThe Petition\nPetitioner Republic opines that although the complaint filed against respondents is for violation of RA 3019, the same is related to the efforts of the government to recover ill-gotten wealth from President Marcos' cronies, or from persons closely and personally associated with him. Thus, the right of the State to recover such properties unlawfully acquired by public officials or employees shall not be barred by prescription, laches, or estoppel as per Sec. 15, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution.\nFurthermore, the Constitutional Commission's intention in drafting Sec. 15, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution was to make imprescriptibility applicable to both civil and criminal aspects of the case. Thus, while the phrase \"or to prosecute offenses in connection therewith\" was omitted or deleted in the final version of Sec. 15, Art. XI, such omission or deletion should not override the manifest intent of the Constitutional Commission to make the prosecution of offenses related to ill-gotten wealth imprescriptible.\nAt the time of the execution of the MOA on November 20, 1974 the period of prescription under Sec. 11 of RA 3019 was 10 years. However, on March 16, 1982, Batas Pambansa Bilang (BP) 195 was enacted amending the prescriptive period of violation of RA 3019 to 15 years. Thus, at the time of the adoption of the 1987 Constitution, the period of prescription for violation of RA 3019 reckoned from the execution of the MOA on November 20, 1974 has not yet set in. Also, Sec. 11 of RA 3019 was similarly amended by Sec. 15, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution with respect to imprescriptibility of offenses related to ill-gotten wealth.\nNonetheless, granting that the offense committed by respondents is not imprescriptible, the reckoning point shall not be from the execution of the MOA on November 20, 1974, but from the EDSA Revolution in February 1986. The Republic, citing Sec. 2 of Act No. 3326,which provides that \"prescription shall begin to run from the day of the commission of the violation of law, and if the same be not known at the time, from the discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceedings,\" argues that the reckoning point of the prescriptive period must be from the discovery of the alleged violation, i.e., at the time of the EDSA Revolution in February 1986 and not from the execution of the MOA on November 20, 1974.\nRepublic explains that the acts complained of were committed during the Marcos regime by persons closely associated with President Marcos, which means that no one could have known the existence of the said MOA dated November 20, 1974 except respondents themselves. Even assuming that third parties knew of the existence of the subject MOA, no one had the reasonable opportunity nor political will to prosecute respondents or the persons involved therein. Considering the peculiar circumstances at that time, the prescriptive period should be reckoned from the discovery of the offense, i.e., immediately after the EDSA Revolution in February 1986. Thus, since the complaint was only filed in 1990 or four years from 1986, the offense charged against respondents has not yet prescribed.\nIn addition, the Ombudsman's ruling that the subject MOA is not grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government, as it was confirmed and ratified by PD 582 and PD 1468, is not correct. The Ombudsman's conclusion: (a) that the ratification of the subject MOA is at the very least a declaration on the part of the government that the agreement is valid, legal, and beneficial to it; and (b) that the act of the officers of NIDC were valid and legal, is palpable error as it gives upon the lawmaker the power to adjudicate on the validity of contracts which is essentially a judicial function.\nAlso, the terms and conditions of the subject MOA were on its face grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government. The Republic likewise assails the failure of the UCPB BOD to appeal and question the arbitral award in favor of AII to the detriment of the CIDF.\nRespondent Enrile's Arguments\nRespondent Enrile contends that Republic's Petition under Rule 65 should be dismissed as it is a mere attempt to substitute a lost appeal. He notes that Sec. 27 of RA 6770,otherwise known as theOmbudsman Act, provides for the specific mode or manner of assailing orders, directives or decisions issued by the Office of the Ombudsman, specifically, by filing a petition forcertiorariwithin 10 days from receipt of the written notice of the order, directive or decision, or denial of the motion for reconsideration in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.\nThus, the Republic chose the wrong mode of appeal when it filed a petition under Rule 65. By filing a petition under Rule 65 instead of Rule 45, the Republic has clearly failed to avail of the plain, speedy, and adequate remedy provided by law within the reglementary period, i.e., Sec. 27 of RA 6770 or a petition under Rule 45. Considering the Republic's failure to file a petition under Rule 45 within 10 days from receipt of the Ombudsman's denial of its motion for reconsideration, it lost the right to assail both the Review and Recommendation dated August 6, 1998 and Order dated September 25, 1998.\nEven assuming that the petition under Rule 65 is the correct remedy, the same was filed out of time which warrants its outright dismissal. The Republic had 60 days from the receipt of the Review of Recommendation dated August 6, 1998 as approved by Ombudsman Desierto,i.e.,from August 28, 1998, within which to file a petition under Rule 65. However, it filed a motion for reconsideration on September 11, 1998 instead which effectively interrupts the filing of the petition under Rule 65. As per Sec. 4, Rule 65, the petitioner has only the balance of the 60-day period from the notice of the denial of the motion for reconsideration within which to file a petition under Rule 65 or until December 13, 1998. Hence, Republic's filing of the instant petition only on December 28, 1998 is clearly beyond the reglementary period.\nAlso, the offense charged in OMB-0-9-2808 has already prescribed Sec. 15, Art. XI of the 1987 Constitution cannot be given an amending or repealing effect as it would impair vested rights. When the complaint was filed, he had already acquired a vested right to be protected on the ground of prescription of the offense charged against him.\nMoreover, the strict application of Sec. 15, Art. XI,i.e.,imprescriptibility of criminal offense in relation to ill-gotten wealth, will violate Sec. 22, Art. III of the Constitution which prohibits enactment of bills of attainder andex-post factolaws. Even if the prescriptive period is 15 years as per BP 195, the offense has already prescribed since the running of the prescriptive period has not been interrupted by any judicial proceeding, i.e., filing of the criminal case in court, as required under Sec. 2 of Act No. 3326.\nHe insists that the running of the prescriptive period should be reckoned from the execution of the MOA on November 20, 1974. The MOA is duly notarized which makes it a public document subject to examination and discovery of anyone. During the execution of the MOA, civil courts were open and functioning which negates Republic's contention that there is no available forum to question the legality of the agreement.\nFurthermore, not only did PD 961 and PD 1468 confirm and ratify the MOA dated November 20, 1974, and its supplements and amendments, they also elevated the MOA from a mere agreement binding only between parties to a contract with force and effect of law. Thus, even if Enrile participated in the negotiation, perfection, and enforcement of the MOA dated November 20, 1974, he cannot be made criminally liable because his acts and\/or involvement therein were mandated by law.\nLastly, the terms and conditions of the MOA dated November 20, 1974 are fair and reasonable to both parties and are not disadvantageous to the government. No liability may be imputed to him in merely noting the subject arbitral award in favor of AII instead of assailing the same. When he signed Resolution No. 111-83, it was for the sole purpose of attesting to the truth and correctness of the minutes and not for the purpose of approving any action or resolution. He also stresses that UCPB is a commercial and private bank owned by coconut farmers and not by the government. Thus, he cannot be made liable as a public officer as defined under Sec. 2 of RA 3019 for his acts as the Chairman of UCPB's BOD.Respondent Concepcion's Arguments\nRespondent Concepcion argues that the petition should be dismissed for failure of the Republic to comply with Sec. 3, Rule 46, that is, the petition shall be filed with proof of service thereof on the respondent. In fact, Republic admitted that it had not served copies of the petition or subsequent pleadings to respondents Concepcion and Lobregat. Moreover, respondent Concepcion contends that since he was served a copy of the petition only on August 3, 2004, the petition is deemed to have been properly filed only on such date. Thus, the petition is filed beyond the 60-day reglementary period under Rule 65.\nFurther, the Republic has no cause of action against him in view of the dismissal of Civil Case No. 0033-C filed before the Sandiganbayan involving the same acts or omissions as in the present case. The quantum of proof required in civil cases is preponderance of evidence while in criminal cases, as in the case at bar, is proof beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, with the dismissal of SB Civil Case No. 0033-C against him, which only requires a lesser quantum of proof, there is more reason to dismiss the criminal case OMB-0-9-2808 filed against respondent Concepcion.\nIn addition, his participation in the alleged acts or omissions subject of this criminal case OMB-0-9-2808 was done and\/or performed in the course of his professional duties as a lawyer. He citesRegala v. Sandiganbayan(Regala) wherein this Court declared that the Angara Abello Concepcion Regala & Cruz (ACCRA) lawyers, of which respondent Concepcion is a partner, were being prosecuted solely on the basis of activities and services performed in the course of their duties as lawyers. Hence, the PCGG had no valid cause of action against them, and the ACCRA lawyers were excluded as parties-defendants in SB Civil Case No. 0033-C. Similarly, respondent Concepcion prays for the dismissal of criminal case OMB-0-90-2808 filed against him as there is no reason to prosecute him as a lawyer.\nMoreover, the running of the 10-year prescriptive period should be reckoned from the EDSA Revolution in 1986. Thus, the offense shall prescribe in 1996. In order to interrupt the prescription of offense, a criminal proceeding should be instituted before the Sandiganbayan. However, no criminal proceedings have been instituted against respondent Concepcion before the lapse of the prescriptive period in 1996. Hence, he can no longer be validly prosecuted for the acts or omissions subject of OMB-0-90-2808.\nNonetheless, inPresidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto,this Court ruled that the prescriptive period was interrupted upon the filing of the complaint with the Ombudsman. Respondent Concepcion however, contends that this new doctrine should be prospectively applied considering that it was rendered by this Court years after the alleged commission of the subject offense charged and after the filing of OMB-0-90-2808. Thus, to retroactively apply the said ruling would constitutionally impair his substantive right to prescription.Respondent Dela Cuesta's Arguments\nSimilarly, respondent Dela Cuesta opines that due to Republic's failure to appeal within the reglementary period, the Ombudsman's Review and Recommendation dated August 6, 1998 became final and executory. Even assuming that the correct remedy is a petition forcertiorariunder Rule 65, the same was filed out of time. Dela Cuesta notes that Republic only served him a copy of the subject Petition on June 27, 2008 or almost nine years and eight months from the time the Republic was notified of the Order dated September 25, 1998. Thus, the petition should be dismissed for being invalid and contrary to Sec. 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court.\nIn the same vein, the time to prosecute the offense charged has already prescribed. The alleged violation of RA 3019 was committed on November 20, 1974. Thus, since no judicial proceedings are instituted against respondents, the running of the prescriptive period has not been interrupted.\nHe likewise argues that the MOA dated November 20, 1974 is duly notarized which makes it a public document subject to the examination and discovery of any one with the exercise of reasonable diligence. At the time of the execution of the MOA, civil courts are open and functioning. In addition, PD 961 and PD 1468 ratified the subject MOA which negates Republic's allegation that the terms of the MOA are grossly disadvantageous to the government.\nEven granting that the reckoning point of the prescriptive period, i.e., 15 years, is in February 1986, the offense charged has still prescribed since he only became a party to the instant petition on June 27, 2008 or three years and four months after the prescription of offense on February 12, 2005.\nFurthermore, the petition should be dismissed for palpable violations of his right to speedy disposition of cases. A period of 17 years reckoned from the filing of the case before the PCGG is a long period of time. Also, the reasons for the delay are all attributable to the Republic. He further contends that this is the only opportune time for him to invoke his right to speedy disposition as he was not served a copy of the instant petition earlier. He adds that he invoked his right to speedy disposition in related cases filed against him.\nLastly, Dela Cuesta opines that Civil Case No. 0033-C, which pertains to the same act or omission alleged in the case at bar, pending before the Sandiganbayan, excluded him as a respondent. He argues that since the quantum of evidence required in civil cases is only preponderance of evidence, the subject criminal case with a higher quantum of evidence cannot prosper.Respondents Ursuaand Pineda'sArguments\nRespondents Ursua and Pineda contend that other than self-serving statements, petitioner Republic failed to offer any substantial evidence to support the alleged grave abuse of discretion, manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence on the part of the Ombudsman. They citedEspinosa v. Office of the OmbudsmanandThe Presidential Ad-Hoc Fact Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desiertoto support their contention that courts consistently refrain from interfering with the Ombudsman's powers and independence.\nLastly, citingPresidential Commission on Good Government v. Desierto,they argue that the Ombudsman has the power to determine whether there exists reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof. The Court will not ordinarily interfere with the Ombudsman's exercise of its investigatory and prosecutorial powers without good and compelling reasons. While there are certain exceptions when the Court may intervene, respondents Ursua and Pineda aver that none applies in the present case.\nOur Ruling\nWe find the petition partly meritorious.\nDeath of accused during the pendency of a criminal action\nAt the outset, respondents Eleazar, Jr., Orosa, Lobregat, and Cojuangco Jr died during the pendency of this petition. Article 89 of the Revised Penal Code states that:\nART. 89.How criminal liability is totally extinguished. Criminal liability is totally extinguished:\n1. By the death of the convict, as to the personal penalties; and as to pecuniary penalties, liability therefor is extinguished only when the death of the offender occurs before final judgment[.]\nInPeople v. Bayotas,We explained the effects of the death of the accused pending appeal, to wit:\n1. Death of the accused pending appeal of his\/[her] conviction extinguishes his\/[her] criminal liability as well as the civil liability based solely thereon. As opined by Justice Regalado, in this regard, \"the death of the accused prior to final judgment terminates his\/[her] criminal liability andonlythe civil liabilitydirectlyarising from and based solely on the offense committed,i.e., civil liabilityex delicto in senso strictiore.\"\n2. Corollarily, the claim for civil liability survives notwithstanding the death of accused, if the same may also be predicated on a source of obligation other thandelict.Article 1157 of the Civil Code enumerates these other sources of obligation from which the civil liability may arise as a result of the same act or omission:\na) Law\nb) Contracts\nc) Quasi-contracts\nd) [x x x]\ne) Quasi-delicts\n3. Where the civil liability survives, as explained in Number 2 above, an action for recovery therefor may be pursued but only by way of filing a separate civil action and subject to Section 1, Rule 111 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure as amended. This separate civil action may be enforced either against the executor\/administrator or the estate of the accused, depending on the source of obligation upon which the same is based as explained above.\n4. Finally, the private offended party need not fear a forfeiture of his\/[her] right to file this separate civil action by prescription, in cases where during the prosecution of the criminal action and prior to its extinction, the private-of­fended party instituted together therewith the civil action. In such case, the statute of limitations on the civil liability is deemed interrupted during the pendency of the criminal case, conformably with provisions of Article 1155 of the Civil Code, that should thereby avoid any apprehension on a possible privation of right by prescription.\nWith the demise of respondents Eleazar, Jr., Orosa, Lobregat, and Cojuangco, Jr., their criminal liabilities and civil liability ex delicto are now extinguished. For the civil liability, which may be based on sources other than delict, the Republic may file a separate civil action against the estate of respondents Eleazar, Jr., Orosa, Lobregat, and Cojuangco, Jr. as may be warranted by law and procedural rules; or if already filed, the said separate civil action shall survive notwithstanding the dismissal of the criminal case in view of their deaths.\nApropos,the subsequent discussion pertains only to the imputation of grave abuse of discretion on the Ombudsman as to its order of dismissal of the Complaint against respondents Enrile, Dela Cuesta, Concepcion, Ursua, and Pineda on the ground of prescription.\nPropriety of the Petition\nBefore We delve into the merits of the case, We deem it necessary to determine the propriety of the petition. Sec. 27 of RA 6770 provides that:\nEffectivity and Finality of Decisions. x x x\nx x x x\nIn all administrative disciplinary cases, orders, directives, or decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman may be appealed to the Supreme Court by filing a petition forcertiorariwithin ten (10) days from receipt of the written notice of the order, directive or decision or denial of the motion for reconsideration in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. (Emphasis supplied)\nHowever, the above provision was already declared unconstitutional inFabian v. Desiertofor expanding the Supreme Court's jurisdiction without its consent in violation of Art. VI, Sec. 30 of the Constitution, to wit:\nTaking all the foregoing circumstances in their true legal roles and effects, therefore, Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 cannot validly authorize an appeal to this Court from decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases. It consequently violates the proscription in Section 30, Article VI of the Constitution against a law which increases the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. No countervailing argument has been cogently presented to justify such disregard of the constitutional prohibition which, as correctly explained inFirst Lepanto Ceramics, Inc. vs. The Court of Appeals, et al.,was intended to give this Court a measure of control over cases placed under its appellate jurisdiction. Otherwise, the indiscriminate enactment of legislation enlarging its appellate jurisdiction would unnecessarily burden the Court.(Citations omitted)\nAlso, Sec. 27 of RA 6770 only relates to administrative disciplinary cases.It does not apply to appeals from Ombudsman's rulings in criminal cases,nor to resolutions on preliminary investigationssuch as the case at bar. InNava v. Commission on Audit,We declared that the remedy of an aggrieved party in such criminal case is an action forcertiorariunder Rule 65, to wit:\nThe remedy availed of by petitioner is erroneous. Instead of a petition forcertiorariunder Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, petitioner filed with this Court the present petition for review oncertiorariunder Rule 45 of the Rules of Court pursuant to the provisions of Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770.\nRule 45 of the Rules of Court provides that only judgments or final orders or resolutions of the Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court and other courts, whenever authorized by law, may be the subject of an appeal bycertiorarito this Court. It does not include resolutions of the Ombudsman on preliminary investigations in criminal cases. Petitioner's reliance on Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 is misplaced.Section 27 is involved only whenever an appeal bycertiorariunder Rule 45 is taken from a decision in an administrative disciplinary action. It cannot be taken into account where an original action forcertiorariunder Rule 65 is resorted to as a remedy for judicial review, such as from an incident in a criminal action. In other words, the right to appeal is not granted to parties aggrieved by orders and decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases, like the case at bar. Such right is granted only from orders or decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative cases.\nAn aggrieved party is not left without any recourse.Where the findings of the Ombudsman as to the existence of probable cause is tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, the aggrieved party may file a petition forcertiorariunder Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.(Citations omitted, emphases and underscoring supplied)\nInTirol, Jr. v. Del Rosario,We explained that although the law is silent as to the remedy of the aggrieved in criminal cases, the party is not without recourse as he or she can assail the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause in a petition forcertiorariunder Rule 65 if the same is tainted with grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction,viz.:\nSection 27 of R.A. No. 6770 provides that orders, directives and decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative cases are appealable to the Supreme CourtviaRule 45 of the Rules of Court. However, inFabian v. Desierto,we declared that Section 27 is unconstitutional since it expanded the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, without its advice and consent, in violation of Article VI, Section 30 of the Constitution. Hence, all appeals from decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases may be taken to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\nTrue, the law is silent on the remedy of an aggrieved party in case the Ombudsman found sufficient cause to indict him in criminal or non-administrative cases.We cannot supply such deficiency if none has been provided in the law. We have held that the right to appeal is a mere statutory privilege and may be exercised only in the manner prescribed by, and in accordance with, the provisions of law. Hence, there must be a law expressly granting such privilege. The Ombudsman Act specifically deals with the remedy of an aggrieved party from orders, directives and decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases. As we ruled inFabian, the aggrieved party is given the right to appeal to the Court of Appeals. Such right of appeal is not granted to parties aggrieved by orders and decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases, like finding probable cause to indict accused persons.\nHowever, an aggrieved party is not without recourse where the finding of the Ombudsman as to the existence of probable cause is tainted with grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. An aggrieved party may file a petition forcertiorariunder Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.(Citations omitted, emphases and underscoring supplied)\nVerily, petitioner Republic correctly availed of the remedy of petition forcertiorariunder Rule 65 when it assailed Ombudsman's August 6, 1998 Review and Recommendation and the September 25, 1998 Order which dismissed the complaint against respondents for violation of RA 3019. Petitioner Republic received a copy of the August 6, 1998 Review and Recommendation on August 28, 1998 and the September 25, 1998 Order on October 28, 1998.\nPrior to the Court's promulgation of A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC,Sec. 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides that in case the aggrieved party's motion for new trial or reconsideration is denied, he or she may file a petition under Rule 65 within the remaining period of 60 days, which in no case shall be less than five days, to wit:\nSEC. 4.Where and when petition to be filed. The petition may be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution sought to be assailed in the Supreme Court or, if it relates to the acts or omissions of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, in the Regional Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Supreme Court. It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its jurisdiction. If it involves the acts or omissions of a quasi-judicial agency, and unless otherwise provided by law or these Rules, the petition shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals.\nIf the petitioner had filed a motion for new trial or reconsideration in due time after notice of said judgment, order or resolution, the period herein fixed shall be interrupted. If the motion is denied, the aggrieved party may file the petition within the remaining period, but which shall not be less than five (5) days in any event, reckoned from notice of such denial. No extension of time to file the petition shall be granted except for the most compelling reason and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days.(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nApplying the foregoing, petitioner Republic had until December 13, 1998 within which to file a petition forcertiorariunder Rule 65. However, it only filed the instant petition on December 28, 1998 or 15 days beyond the 60-day reglementary period. Patently, petitioner Republic's petition is filed out of time as per the above-quoted provision.\nNevertheless, during the pendency of the petition, the Court promulgated A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC, which amended Sec. 4 of Rule 65 and became effective on September 1, 2000, to wit:\nSECTION 4.When and where petition filed. The petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of judgment, order or resolution. In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, the sixty (60) day period shall be counted from notice of the denial of said motion.\nThe petition shall be filed in the Supreme Court or, if it relates to the acts or omissions of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, in the Regional Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Supreme Court. It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. If it involves the acts or omissions of a quasi-judicial agency, unless otherwise provided by law or these rules, the petition shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals.\nNo extension of time to file the petition shall be granted except for compelling reason and in no case exceeding fifteen (15) days.(Emphases and underscoring supplied)\nSettled is the rule that statutes regulating the procedure of the courts are construed as applicable to actions pending and undetermined at the time of their passageSince A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC relates to the mode of procedure, i.e., the reglementary period within which to file a petition forcertiorariunder Rule 65, it is applicable to pending cases at the time of its adoption.\nIn the present case, it is apparent that the petition is still pending resolution before this Court when A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC was issued. Similarly, the Court applied A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC retrospectively inPresidential Commission on Good Government v. Desiertowhen it ruled that:\nPrefatorily, the petition should have been dismissed for late filing. Petitioner received a copy of the assailed resolution on 08 April 1999. A motion for reconsideration was filed by the PCGG on 12 April 1999. On 06 August 1999, it received a copy of the order denying its motion for reconsideration. Pursuant to Section 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the petition should have been filed on 02 October 1999; instead, the petition was only posted on 05 October 1999. During the pendency of this case, however, the Court promulgated A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC (Further Amending Section 4, Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure), made effective on 01 September 2000, that provided:\nSECTION 4.When and where petition filed. The petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of judgment, order or resolution. In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, the sixty (60) day period shall be counted from notice of the denial of said motion.\nIn view of the retroactive application of procedural laws, the instant petition should now be considered timely filed.(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nInArk Travel Express Inc. v. Abrogar,the Court upheld the retroactive application of A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC to pending cases before it, to wit:\nThe issue raised in the present petition concerns the jurisdiction of the RTC in ordering the dismissal of the criminal cases pending before the MTC and therefore, the proper remedy iscertiorari. As such, the present petition forcertiorariought to have been dismissed for late filing. The assailed Order dated October 2, 1998 was received by Ark Travel on October 16, 1998. Ark Travel filed the Motion for Reconsideration fourteen days later or on October 30, 1998. On November 27, 1998, Ark Travel received the Order of the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration. Pursuant to Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure, then prevailing, the petition should have been filed on the forty-sixth day (60 days minus 14 days) from November 27, 1998 or on January 12, 1999, the last day of the 60-day reglementary period; instead, the petition was filed on January 26, 1999.\nHowever, during the [sic] pendency of herein petition, the Court promulgated A.M. No. 00-2-03, amending Section 4, Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure, effective September 1, 2000, to wit:\nSEC. 4.When and where petition filed. The petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of judgment, order or resolution. In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, the sixty (60) day period shall be counted from notice of the denial of said motion.\nIn which case, the filing of the petition on January 26, 1999 was filed on the 60th day from November 27, 1998, Ark Travel's date of receipt of notice of the order denying Ark Travel's motion for reconsideration.\nWe have consistently held that statutes regulating the procedure of the courts will be construed as applicable to actions pending and undetermined at the time of their passage  procedural laws are retroactive in that sense and to that extent.In view of such retroactive application of procedural laws the instant petition should be considered as timely filed.(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nTherefore, the retroactive application of A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC, specifically the 60-day period within which to file a petition forcertiorari, which must be reckoned from the notice of the denial of a motion for reconsideration or new trial, shall also be applied to the present case. Thus, petitioner Republic had 60 days from receipt of the September 25, 1998 Order or until December 27, 1998 within which to file a petition. However, since December 27, 1998 is a Sunday, petitioner Republic's filing of its petition on December 28, 1998 is considered timely filed within the 60-day reglementary period.\nAs to the alleged failure of the Republic to timely serve copies of the petition to respondents Concepcion and Lobregat, the pertinent provisions of Sec. 6, Rule 65; Sec. 2, Rule 56; and Sec. 2, 3, and 4, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court are particularly instructive of the effects thereof:\nSection 6, Rule 65\nSECTION 6.Order to Comment. If the petition is sufficient in form and substance to justify such process, the court shall issue an order requiring the respondent or respondents to comment on the petition within ten (10) days from receipt of a copy thereof. Such order shall be served on the respondents in such manner as the court may direct, together with a copy of the petition and any annexes thereto.\nIn petitions forcertioraribefore the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, the provisions of Section 2, Rule 56, shall be observed.Before giving due course thereto, the court may require the respondents to file their comment to, and not a motion to dismiss, the petition. Thereafter, the court may require the filing of a reply and such other responsive or other pleadings as it may deem necessary and proper. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nSection 2, Rule 56\nSECTION 2.Rules Applicable.The procedure in original cases forcertiorari, prohibition,mandamus, quo warrantoandhabeas corpusshall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Constitution, laws, and Rules 46, 48, 49, 51, 52 and this Rule,subject to the following provisions:\na) All references in said Rules to the Court of Appeals shall be understood to also apply to the Supreme Court;\nb) The portions of said Rules dealing strictly with and specifically intended for appealed cases in the Court of Appeals shall not be applicable; and\nc)Eighteen (18) clearly legible copies of the petition shall be filed, together with proof of service on all adverse parties.(Emphases and underscoring supplied)\nSections 2, 3 and 4, Rule 46\nSECTION 2.To What Actions Applicable.This Rule shall apply to original actions forcertiorari, prohibition,mandamus and quo warranto.\nExcept as otherwise provided, the actions for annulment of judgment shall be governed by Rule 47,  forcertiorari, prohibition andmandamusby Rule 65, and for quo warranto by Rule 66.\nSECTION 3.Contents and Filing of Petition; Effect of Non-Compliance with Requirements. The petition shall contain the full names and actual addresses of all the petitioners and respondents, a concise statement of the matters involved, the factual background of the case, and the grounds relied upon for the relief prayed for.\nx x x x\nIt shall be filedin seven (7) clearly legible copiestogether with proof of service thereof on the respondentwith the original copy intended for the court indicated as such by the petitioner, and shall be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original or certified true copy of the judgment, order, resolution, or ruling subject thereof, such material portions of the record as are referred to therein, and other documents relevant or pertinent thereto. The certification shall be accomplished by the proper clerk of court or by his duly authorized representative, or by the proper officer of the court, tribunal, agency or office involved or by his duly authorized representative. The other requisite number of copies of the petition shall be accompanied by clearly legible plain copies of all documents attached to the original.\nThe petitioner shall also submit together with the petition a sworn certification that he has not theretofore commenced any other action involving the same issues in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals or different divisions thereof, or any other tribunal or agency; if there is such other action or proceeding, he must state the status of the same; and if he should thereafter learn that a similar action or proceeding has been filed or is pending before the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or different divisions thereof, or any other tribunal or agency, he undertakes to promptly inform the aforesaid courts and other tribunal or agency thereof within five (5) days therefrom.\nThe petitioner shall pay the corresponding docket and other lawful fees to the clerk of court and deposit the amount of P500.00 for costs at the time of the filing of the petition.\nThe failure of the petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition.\nSECTION 4.Jurisdiction Over Person of Respondent, How Acquired.\nThe court shall acquire jurisdiction over the person of the respondent by the service on him\/[her] of its order or resolution indicating its initial action on the petition or by his\/[her] voluntary submission to such jurisdiction.(Emphases and underscoring supplied)\nBased on the above-quoted provisions, the petition must be accompanied by a proof of service to respondents. Failure to comply with said requirement shall be a sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition. The Court shall acquire jurisdiction over the person of the respondent upon service on him or her of its order or resolution indicating its initial action on the petition or by voluntary submission.\nAs per the records, petitioner Republic served copies of the petition to the respondents through Atty. Estelito Mendoza (Atty. Mendoza). However, respondents Lobregat and Concepcion turned out to have not received their respective copies of the petition and all subsequent pleadings and resolutions. Thus, they failed to file their Comment on the petition.\nPatently, petitioner Republic's alleged failure to timely serve copies of the petition to respondents Lobregat and Concepcion shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal of its Petition under Rule 65. However, petitioner Republic clarified that such procedural infirmity was an honest mistake as it relied on what was stated in the August 6, 1998 Review and Recommendation and September 25, 1998 Order directing that copies thereof be sent to respondents through Atty. Mendoza. Hence, petitioner Republic likewise served copies of the petition to Lobregat and Concepcion through Atty. Mendoza.\nNonetheless, instead of dismissing the petition outright, this Court in its July 7, 2004 Resolution consequently reversed and set aside the August 23, 2001 Decision and allowed the filing of the Comments of all the respondents. It is worth noting that notice to adverse party is important to prevent surprise and to afford the latter a chance to be heard in keeping with the principle of procedural due process. However, it is also well-settled that procedural rules may be relaxed when a \"stringent application of [the same] would hinder rather than serve the demands of substantial justice.\"\nInSanchez v. Court of Appeals,We listed the elements to be considered to warrant the suspension of the Rules, to wit:\nAside from matters of life, liberty, honor or property which would warrant the suspension of the Rules of the most mandatory character and an examination and review by the appellate court of the lower court's findings of fact, the other elements that should be considered are the following: (a) the existence of special or compelling circumstances, (b) the merits of the case, (c) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules, (d) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory, and (e) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.\nInGinete v. Court of Appeals,We explained the rationale in the relaxation of the rules of procedure in case of justifiable instances, to wit:\nLet it be emphasized that the rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed. Even the Rules of Court reflect this principle. The power to suspend or even disregard rules can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court itself has already declared to be final, as we are now constrained to do in instant case.\nThus, this court is not averse to suspending its own rules in the pursuit of the ends of justice. \"[x x x] For when the operation of the Rules will lead to an injustice we have, in justifiable instances, resorted to this extraordinary remedy to prevent it. The rules have been drafted with the primary objective of enhancing fair trials and expediting justice. As acorollary,if their application and operation tend to subvert and defeat, instead of promote and enhance it, their suspension is justified. In the words of Justice Antonio P. Barredo in his concurring opinion in Estrada v. Sto. Domingo, \"(T)his Court, through the revered and eminent Mr. Justice Abad Santos, found occasion in the case ofC. Viuda de Ordoveza v. Raymundo,to lay down for recognition in this jurisdiction, the sound rule in the administration of justice holding that 'it is always in the power of the court (Supreme Court) to suspend its own rules or to except a particular case from its operation, whenever the purposes of justice require it [x x x]\"\nThe Rules of Court were conceived and promulgated to set forth guidelines in the dispensation of justice but not to bind and chain the hand that dispenses it, for otherwise, courts will be mere slaves to or robots of technical rules, shorn of judicial discretion. That is precisely why courts, in rendering justice have always been, as they in fact ought to be, conscientiously guided by the norm that on the balance, technicalities take a backseat to substantive rights, and not the other way around. As applied to instant case, in the language of Justice Makalintal, technicalities \"should give way to the realities of the situation.\"\nClearly, the present case pertains to the Ombudsman's investigation of respondents' purported violation of RA 3019 allegedly involving government funds and\/or property. The Republic should not be faulted by the OSG's failure to timely serve copies of the petition to respondents Concepcion and Lobregat within the reglementary period. Besides, petitioner Republic provided justifiable reason for its failure to comply with the procedural requirements in filing the instant petition. Also, to deny Republic's privilege to question the assailed OMB's August 6, 1998 Review and Recommendation and the September 25, 1998 Order would frustrate, rather than promote, substantial justice, especially when the case involves purportedly public funds and\/or property. Hence, considering the existence of special or compelling circumstance, the technical rules of procedure may be relaxed in this case in order to serve the demands of substantial justice.\nGrave abuse of discretion\nHaving resolved that the instant Petition under Rule 65 was correctly and timely filed in accordance with the rules, We come now to the issue of grave abuse of discretion imputed against the Ombudsman when it ordered the dismissal of OMB-0-90-2808 on the ground of prescription.\nOrdinarily, the Court does not interfere with the Ombudsman's determination as to the existence or non-existence of probable cause except when there is grave abuse of discretion.As defined, \"grave abuse of discretion means such capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment which is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. To justify judicial intervention, the abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility.\"\nNotably, the Ombudsman's assailed Orders did not specifically rule on the existence or non-existence of probable cause to indict or exonerate respondents Concepcion, Dela Cuesta, Enrile, Ursua, and Pineda of violation of RA 3019. Instead, the Ombudsman ordered the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of prescription.\nAfter a careful review of the records, the Court finds judicial intervention is justified and proper in this case to determine the correctness of the Ombudsman's order of dismissal on the ground of prescription as per relevant laws and jurisprudence.\nWe emphasize that We are not ruling on the guilt or innocence of the respondents. Instead, Our focus is on the plausible allegations of Republic, which may determine whether a violation of the special law was apparent at the time of its commission.\nPrescription of offense\nTo resolve the issues concerning prescription of offenses, the Court must determine the following: (a) the prescriptive period of the offense; (b) when the period commenced to run; and (c) when the period was interrupted.\n(a) Prescriptive Period of the Offense\nAt the time of enactment of RA 3019, the original prescriptive period of offenses defined and penalized therein was 10 years.Thereafter, on March 16, 1982, BP 195extended the prescriptive period in filing cases for violation of RA 3019 from 10 years to 15 years. Subsequently, the prescriptive period for violation of RA 3019 was extended to 20 years as per RA 10910,which took effect on July 21, 2016.\nIt bears stressing that the Complaint charged respondents with violation of RA 3019 on account of the execution of the MOA with AII on November 20, 1974. The prescriptive period during that time for offenses punishable under RA 3019 was 10 years. Clearly, the amendatory laws,i.e.,BP 195 and RA 10910, which provide longer periods of prescription, cannot be retroactively applied to crimes committed prior to their passage in 1982 and 2016, respectively.InPeople v. Pacificador,the rule is that \"in the interpretation of the law on prescription of crimes, that which is more favorable to the accused is to be adopted.\"Therefore, the applicable prescriptive period in the instant case is 10 years.\n(b)When the period commenced to run\nAs to the reckoning point of the prescriptive period, RA 3019 fails to explicitly provide. Thus, reference is to be made to Act No. 3326which governs the prescription of offenses punished by special penal laws.\nSec. 2 of Act No. 3326 provides that prescription commences from: (a) the day of the commission of the violation of the law, which is the general rule; or (b) if the same is not known, from the time of discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceeding for its investigation and punishment, which is the exception and otherwise known as the discovery rule or the blameless ignorance doctrine. The discovery rule or the blameless ignorance doctrine states:\nSECTION 2.Prescription shall begin to run from the day of the commission of the violation of the law, and if the same be not known at the time, from the discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceeding for investigation and punishment.\nThe prescription shall be interrupted when proceedings are instituted against the guilty person, and shall begin to run again if the proceedings are dismissed tor reasons not constituting jeopardy. (Emphasis supplied)\nAs elucidated inDel Rosario v. People,as a general rule, \"the fact that any aggrieved person entitled to an action has no knowledge of his\/[her] right to sue or of the facts out of which his\/[her] right arises does not prevent the running of the prescriptive period.\"On the other hand, the blameless ignorance rule provides that \"the statute of limitations runs only upon discovery of the fact of the invasion of a right which will support a cause of action.\"\nInPresidential Commission on Good Government v. Carpio-Morales (Carpio-Morales),the Court explains the construction of the discovery rule or the blameless ignorance doctrine and provides guidelines in the determination of the reckoning point for the period of prescription of violations of RA 3019, to wit:\nThe first mode being self-explanatory, We proceed with Our construction of the second mode.\nIn interpreting the meaning of the phrase \"if the same be not known at the time, from the discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceeding for its investigation,\" this Court has, as early as 1992 inPeople v. Duque,held that in cases where the illegality of the activity is not known to the complainant at the time of its commission, Act No. 3326, Section 2 requires that prescription, in such a case, would begin to run only from the discovery thereof, i.e., discovery of the unlawful nature of the constitutive act or acts.\nIt is also inDuquewhere this Court espoused the raison d'être for the second mode. We said, \"[i]n the nature of things, acts made criminal by special laws are frequently not immoral or obviously criminal in themselves; for this reason, the applicable statute requires that if the violation of the special law is not known at the time, the prescription begins to run only from the discovery thereof, i.e., discovery of the unlawful nature of the constitutive act or acts.\"\nFurther clarifying the meaning of the second mode, the Court, in Duque, held that Section 2 should be read as \"[p]rescription shall begin to run from the day of the commission of the violation of the law, and if the same be not known at the time, from the discovery thereof anduntilthe institution of judicial proceedings for its investigation and punishment.\" Explaining the reason therefor, this Court held that a contrary interpretation would create the absurd situation where \"the prescription period would both begin and be interrupted by the same occurrence; the net effect would be that the prescription period would not have effectively begun, having been rendered academic by the simultaneous interruption of that same period.\" Additionally, this interpretation is consistent with the second paragraph of the same provision which states that \"prescription shall be interrupted when proceedings are instituted against the guilty person, [and shall] begin to run again if the proceedings are dismissed for reasons not constituting jeopardy.\"\nApplying the same principle, We have consistently held in a number of cases, some of which likewise involve behest loans contracted during the Marcos regime, that the prescriptive period for the crimes therein involved generally commences from the discovery thereof, and not on the date of its actual commission.\nIn the 1999 and 2011 cases ofPresidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto, the Court, in said separate instances, reversed the ruling of the Ombudsman that the prescriptive period therein began to run at the time the behest loans were transacted and instead, it should be counted from the date of the discovery thereof.\nIn the 1999 case, We recognized the impossibility for the State, the aggrieved party, to have known the violation of RA 3019 at the time the questioned transactions were made in view of the fact that the public officials concerned connived or conspired with the \"beneficiaries of the loans.\" There, We agreed with the contention of the Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee that the prescriptive period should be computed from the discovery of the commission thereof and not from the day of such commission. It was also in the same case where We clarified that the phrase \"if the same be not known\" in Section 2 of Act No. 3326 does not mean \"lack of knowledge\" but that the crime \"is not reasonably knowable\" is unacceptable. Furthermore, in this 1999 case, We intimated that the determination of the date of the discovery of the offense is a question of fact which necessitates the reception of evidence for its determination.\nSimilarly, in the 2011 Desierto case, We ruled that the \"blameless ignorance\" doctrine applies considering that the plaintiff therein had no reasonable means of knowing the existence of a cause of action. In this particular instance, We pinned the running of the prescriptive period to the completion by the Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee of an exhaustive investigation on the loans. We elucidated that the first mode under Section 2 of Act No. 3326 would not apply since during the Marcos regime, no person would have dared to question the legality of these transactions.\nPrior to the 2011 Desierto case came Our 2006 Resolution inRomualdez v. Marcelo, which involved a violation of Section 7 of RA 3019. In resolving the issue of whether or not the offenses charged in the said cases have already prescribed, We applied the same principle enunciated inDuqueand ruled that the prescriptive period for the offenses therein committed began to run from the discovery thereof on the day former Solicitor General Francisco I. Chavez filed the complaint with the PCGG.\nThis was reiterated inDisini v. Sandiganbayanwhere We counted the running of the prescriptive period in said case from the date of discovery of the violation after the PCGG's exhaustive investigation despite the highly publicized and well-known nature of the Philippine Nuclear Power Plant Project therein involved, recognizing the fact that the discovery of the crime necessitated the prior exhaustive investigation and completion thereof by the PCGG.\nInRepublic v. Cojuangco, Jr.,however, We held that not all violations of RA 3019 require the application of the second mode for computing the prescription of the offense. There, this Court held that the second element for the second mode to apply, i.e., that the action could not have been instituted during the prescriptive period because of martial law, is absent. This is so since information about the questioned investment therein was not suppressed from the discerning eye of the public nor has the Office of the Solicitor General made any allegation to that effect. This Court likewise faulted therein petitioner for having remained dormant during the remainder of the period of prescription despite knowing of the investment for a sufficiently long period of time.\nAn evaluation of the foregoing jurisprudence on the matter reveals the following guidelines in the determination of the reckoning point for the period of prescription of violations of RA 3019,viz.:\n1. As a general rule, prescription begins to run from the date of the commission of the offense.\n2. If the date of the commission of the violation is not known, it shall be counted form the date of discovery thereof.\n3. In determining whether it is the general rule or the exception that should apply in a particular case, the availability or suppression of the information relative to the crime should first be determined.\nIf the necessary information, data, or records based on which the crime could be discovered is readily available to the public, the general rule applies. Prescription shall, therefore, run from the date of the commission of the crime.\nOtherwise, should martial law prevent the filing thereof or should information about the violation be suppressed, possibly through connivance, then the exception applies and the period of prescription shall be reckoned from the date of discovery thereof.(Emphasis supplied)\nApplying the foregoing principles and based on Our judicious review of the records, We are convinced that the exception on the date of discovery or the blameless ignorance doctrine applies to the case at bar.\n(i) The Republic could not have questioned the MOA because it was given legislative imprimatur.\nIt is worth noting that although the MOA dated November 20, 1974 was duly notarized and presumably available to the public for scrutiny and perusal, the same was executed and entered into by the parties pursuant to PD 582 issued by then President Marcos. Respondents even contended, and the Ombudsman ruled in the assailed Orders, that the said MOA was given legislative imprimatur. This allegedly implies that the respondents cannot be prosecuted for their involvement in the execution, implementation, and termination of the said MOA. Hinging from the same argument, the fact that the MOA dated November 20, 1974 was executed pursuant to a legislative enactment, i.e., PD 582, the more it is highly impossible for the Republic to question the same, and the respondents' alleged violation of RA 3019 and involvement in the execution, implementation and termination of the MOA.\nHence, contrary to respondents' contention and the Ombudsman's assailed Orders, We are not persuaded that the prescriptive period began to run in 1974 when the MOA with AII was executed since petitioner Republic could not have possibly questioned the respondents for their alleged violation of RA 3019 because it was given \"legislative imprimatur\" at that time. In other words, it is not possible for the Republic, as the aggrieved party, to have known respondents' alleged violation of RA 3019 prior to the 1986 Freedom Constitution which specifically mandated the President to prioritize among others the: (a) recovery of ill-gotten properties amassed by the leaders and supporters of the previous regime and protection of the interest of the people through orders of sequestration or freezing of assets of accounts; and (b) eradication of graft and corruption in government and punishment of those guilty thereof.Only then did the Republic have the opportune time to discover acts or violations of RA 3019 in connection with the MOA dated November 20, 1974 executed during the Marcos administration.\nSimilar toDisini v. Sandiganbayan,even arguing that the MOA dated November 20, 1974 is publicly known as it involves government funds and affects the Philippine coconut industry, it would have been futile for petitioner Republic to question the same and charge herein respondents with violation of RA 3019 as no person would have dared to assail the legality of MOA dated November 20, 1974 considering that President Marcos himself, exercising legislative power, issued PD 582 which paved the way for the subject MOA.\nSimilar to PD 582, the amendments introduced in PD 961 and PD 1468 went unnoticed prior to the date of discovery of the violation of RA 3019. To recall, both PD 961 and PD 1468 gave the MOA an appearance of validity.\nSec. 3-B of PD 582 authorizes the execution of a contract for the financing of a hybrid coconut seednut farm. Through PD 582, NIDC was given blanket authority to negotiate the contract on behalf of the government.\nWith the amendments introduced by PD 961, a confirmatory phrase was added: \"x x x the contract entered into by NIDC as herein authorized is hereby confirmed and ratified; x x x.\" While PD 582 paved the way for the MOA, PD 961 confirmed and ratified it.\nFinally, upon further amendment by PD 1468, any amendment or supplement to the contract was likewise confirmed and ratified. The phrase reads: \"x x x the contract, including the amendments and supplements thereto as provided for herein, entered into by NIDC as herein authorized is hereby confirmed and ratified x x x.\" In effect, the series of supplemental agreements and amendments subsequent to the MOA were confirmed and ratified.\nWith the legislative imprimatur of PD 582, PD 961, and PD 1468, it became nearly impossible for petitioner Republic to question the MOA and its series of supplemental agreements and amendments prior to the discovery of the offense. For this reason, the discovery rule or blameless ignorance doctrine applies.\n(ii) There were material subsequent events that transpired after  the execution of the MOA, but prior to the filing of the Complaint.\nApart from the disadvantageous provisions of the MOA, there are material subsequent events in 1982 and 1983 that transpired after the execution of the MOA. These material subsequent events suggest the plausibility of a violation of RA 3019.\nIn the Complaint, petitioner Republic alleged that certain events transpired after the execution of the MOA. These events include the following: (1) UCPB Board of Directors' adoption of Resolution No. 111-83 on April 19, 1983;(2) UCPB Board of Directors' act of allowing the arbitral award to lapse into finality;and (3) directorships of Enrile, Cojuangco, Jr., Dela Cuesta, and Concepcion at AII until November 8, 1982,among many others. These materials events transpired from 1982 to 1983, after the execution of the MOA and well before the filing of the Complaint in 1990.\nAppreciation of these events is necessary in determining when the prescriptive period commenced to run because the acts of certain respondents corroborate their direct or indirect participation in violation of RA 3019. We note that respondents Ursua and Pineda were neither signatories to the MOA nor directors of AII. Nonetheless, respondents Ursua and Pineda were members of UCPB's Board of Directors in 1983, whose acts still put the government at a disadvantage. Thus, as to respondents Ursua and Pineda, the action is not barred by prescription whether the general rule on date of commission or the exception on date of discovery is applied.\nTaken in its entirety, the material subsequent acts of respondents prove that any information about the violation was suppressed. Thus, the discovery rule or blameless ignorance doctrine applies.\n(iii) The Complaint is replete with allegations of conspiracy and connivance.\nInCarpio-Morales,We recognized that the reckoning point for the period of prescription of violations of RA 3019 may commence on the date of discovery when information about the violation of RA 3019 is suppressed, possibly through connivance.\nHere, the Complaint is replete with allegations of conspiracy and connivance in the suppression of information about the violation. Republic alleged as follows: (1) Cojuangco, Jr. took advantage of his close relationship with then President Marcos for his own personal and business interests through the issuance of favorable decrees;(2) Cojuangco, Jr. caused the Philippine Government, through the NIDC, to enter into a contract with him, through AII, under terms and conditions grossly disadvantageous to the government and in conspiracy with the members of the UCPB Board of Directors, in flagrant breach of fiduciary duty as administrator-trustee of the CIDF;(3) Enrile, Dela Cuesta, Concepcion, Ursua, and Pineda, as members of the UCPB Board of Directors, allowed the BOA's March 29, 1983's Decision to lapse into finality, which resulted in the successful siphoning of P840,789,855.33 from CIDF to AII;and (4) respondents were directly or indirectly interested in personal gain, or had material interest in the transaction requiring the approval of a board, panel, or group in which they were members, in violation of RA 3019 to the grave damage and prejudice of the public interest, the Filipino people, the Republic, and the coconut farmers.\nIn Our August 23, 2001 Decision, We deemed that the allegations of conspiracy and connivance were sufficiently established in the pleadings, to wit:\nThere are striking parallelisms between the said Behest Loans Case and the present one which lead us to apply the ruling of the former to the latter.First, both cases arouse out of seemingly innocent business transactions;second,both were \"discovered\" only after the government created bodies to investigate these anomalous transactions;third,both involve prosecutions for violations of R.A. No. 3019; and,fourth,in both cases,it was sufficiently raised in the pleadings that the respondents conspired and connived with one another in order to keep the alleged violations hidden from public scrutiny.\nx x x x\nR.A. No. 3019, as applied to the instant case, covers not only the alleged one-sidedness of the MOA, but also as to whether the contracts or transactions entered pursuant thereto by private respondents were manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government, whether they caused undue injury to the government, and whether the private respondents were interested for personal gain or had material interests in the transactions.\nThe task to determine and find whether probable cause to charge private respondents exists properly belongs to the Ombudsman. We only rule that the Office of the Ombudsman should not have dismissed the complaint on the basis of prescription which is erroneous as hereinabove discussed. The Ombudsman should have given the Solicitor General the opportunity to present his evidence and then resolve the case for purposes of preliminary investigation. Failing to do so, the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion.(Emphasis supplied)\nTaken in its entirety and in view of the unique circumstance of this case, We declare that the reckoning point of the prescriptive period should be from the promulgation of the 1986 Freedom Constitution, which mandated the President to: (a) recover ill-gotten properties amassed by the leaders and supporters of the previous regime and protect the interest of the people through orders of sequestration or freezing of assets of accounts; and (b) eradicate graft and corruption in government and punish those guilty thereof, among others. Only then will the Republic have had the opportune time to discover any alleged acts or violations which would prompt the filing of a necessary action against the culprits.\nTherefore, petitioner Republic's Complaint dated February 12, 1990 filed against respondents before the PCGG, which was subsequently referred to the Ombudsman, for violation of RA 3019 is well within the 10-year prescriptive period of an offense for the alleged illegal act committed based on the MOA dated November 20, 1974.\n(c) When the period was interrupted\nSection 2 of Act No. 3326 clearly provides that prescription shall be interrupted when proceedings are instituted against the accused, to wit:\nSEC. 2. Prescription shall begin to ran from the day of the commission of the violation of the law, and if the same be not known at the time, from the discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceedings for its investigation and punishment.\nThe prescription shall be interrupted when proceedings are instituted against the guilty person, and shall begin to run again if the proceedings are dismissed for reasons not constituting jeopardy.(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nInPerez v. Sandiganbayan(Perez) citingPeople v. Pangilinan(Pangilinan), We declared that\"prescription is interrupted when the preliminary investigation against the accused is commenced,\"to wit:\nPrescription is interrupted when the preliminary investigation against the accused is commenced. InPeople v. Pangilinan, the Court held as follows:\nx x x There is no more distinction between cases under the RPC and those covered by special laws with respect to the interruption of the period of prescription. The ruling inZaldivia v. Reyes. Jr.is not controlling in special laws.InLlenes v. Dicdican, Ingco, et al. v. Sandiganbayan, Brillante v. CA,andSanrio Company Limited v. Lim,cases involving special laws, this Court held that the institution of proceedings for preliminary investigation against the accused interrupts the period of prescription. InSecurities and Exchange Commission v. Interport Resources Corporation, et al.,the Court even ruled that investigations conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission for violations of the Revised Securities Act and the Securities Regulation Code effectively interrupts the prescription period because it is equivalent to the preliminary investigation conducted by the DOJ in criminal cases.\nIn fact, in the case of Panaguiton, Jr. v. Department of Justice, which is [on] all fours with the instant case, this Court categorically ruled that commencement of the proceedings for the prosecution of the accused before the Office of the City Prosecutor effectively interrupted the prescriptive period for the offenses they had been charged under BP Big. 22. Aggrieved parties, especially those who do not sleep on their rights and actively pursue their causes, should not be allowed to suffer unnecessarily further simply because of circumstances beyond their control, like the accused's delaying tactics or the delay and inefficiency of the investigating agencies.(Emphasis in the original)\nInPanaguiton, Jr. v. Department of Justice(Panaguiton), the Court explained the rationale for the rule that prescription is interrupted by the commencement of the preliminary investigation, to wit:\nIt must be pointed out that when Act No. 3326 was passed on 4 December 1926, preliminary investigation of criminal offenses was conducted by justices of the peace, thus, the phraseology in the law, \"institution of judicial proceedings for its investigation and punishment\", and the prevailing rule at the time was that once a complaint is filed with the justice of the peace for preliminary investigation, the prescription of the offense is halted.\nThe historical perspective on the application of Act No. 3326 is illuminating. Act No. 3226 was approved on 4 December 1926 at a time when the function of conducting the preliminary investigation of criminal offenses was vested in the justices of the peace. Thus, the prevailing rule at the time as shown in the cases ofU.S. v. LazadaandPeople v. Josonis that the prescription of the offense is tolled once a complaint is filed with the justice of the peace for preliminary investigation inasmuch as the filing of the complaint signifies the institution of the criminal proceedings against the accused. These cases were followed by our declaration inPeople v. ParaoandParaothat the first step taken in the investigation or examination of offenses partakes the nature of a judicial proceeding which suspends the prescription of the offense. Subsequently, inPeople v. Olarte, we held that the filing of the complaint in the Municipal Court, even if it be merely for purposes of preliminary examination or investigation, should, and does, interrupt the period of prescription of the criminal responsibility, even if the court where the complaint or information is filed cannot try the case on the merits. In addition, even if the court where the complaint or information is filed may only proceed to investigate the case, its actuations already represent the initial step of the proceedings against the offender, and hence, the prescriptive period should be interrupted.\nInIngco v. Sandiganbayan and Sanrio Company Limited v. Lim,which involved violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. No. 3019) and the Intellectual Property Code (R.A. No. 8293), which are both special laws, the Court ruled that the prescriptive period is interrupted by the institution of proceedings for preliminary investigation against the accused. In the more recent case of Securities and Exchange Commission v. Inter port Resources Corporation, et al., the Court ruled that the nature and purpose of the investigation conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission on violations of the Revised Securities Act, another special law, is equivalent to the preliminary investigation conducted by the DOJ in criminal cases, and thus effectively interrupts the prescriptive period.\nPanaguitonfurther held that to rule that the running of the prescriptive period is interrupted only through the institution of judicial proceedings would deprive the injured party of his \"right to obtain vindication on account of delays that are not under his control.\"An aggrieved party who actively pursues his or her cause should not be allowed to suffer unnecessarily simply because of accused's delaying tactics or delay, and inefficiency of the investigating agencies.\nNonetheless, We are not unmindful of the rulings of this Court inJadewell Parking Systems Corp. v. Judge Lidua, Sr.(Jadewell) andZaldivia v. Reyes, Jr.(Zaldivia) which declared that \"the running of the prescriptive period shall be halted on the date the case is actually filed in court and not on any date before that\"and \"[a]s provided in the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, only the filing of an Information tolls the prescriptive period where the crime charged is involved in an ordinance.\"\nIn other words, the Court ruled inJadewellandZaldiviathat when the offense involves violation of a municipal or city ordinance, which is governed by the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, the running of the prescriptive period shall be interrupted only upon the institution of judicial proceedings and not the commencement of the preliminary investigation by the investigating agencies. In ruling so,JadewellandZaldiviamainly anchored on: (a) Sec. 9 of the 1983 Rules on Summary Procedure, which substantially provides that the prosecution of criminal cases falling under the summary procedure shall be either by complaint or by information filed directly in court without need of a prior preliminary examination or preliminary investigation; and (b) Sec. 11 of the 1991 Revised Rules on Summary Procedure which provides that in Metropolitan Manila and in Chartered Cities, the case is commenced only by Information except when the offense cannot be prosecutedde oficio.\nPatently,JadewellandZaldiviaare in apparent conflict withPanaguitonwhich involved a violation of BP 22, which is also within the scope of the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure  the same rules applicable on violation of municipal or city ordinance.\nInPeople v. Lee, Jr.,the Court seemingly distinguished and reconciled the conflict betweenJadewellandPanaguiton,which is affirmed inPeople v. Pangilinan,wherein the former involved prescription for violation of ordinance while the latter refers to violation of special laws, to wit:\nThe doctrine in the Panaguiton case was subsequently affirmed inPeople v. Pangilinan.In this case, the affidavit-complaint forestafaand violation of B.P. Blg. 22 against the respondent was filed before the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Quezon City on September 16, 1997. The complaint stems from respondent's issuance of nine (9) checks in favor of private complainant which were dishonored upon presentment and refusal of the former to heed the latter's notice of dishonor which was made sometime in the latter part of 1995. On February 3, 2000, a complaint for violation of BP Blg. 22 against the respondent was filed before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City, after the Secretary of Justice reversed the recommendation of the OCP of Quezon City approving the \"Petition to Suspend Proceedings on the Ground of Prejudicial Question\" filed by the respondent on the basis of the pendency of a civil case for accounting, recovery of commercial documents and specific performance which she earlier filed before the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela City. The issue of prescription reached this Court after the Court of Appeals (CA), citing Section 2 of Act 3326, sustained respondent's position that the complaint against her for violation of B.P. Blg. 22 had prescribed.\nIn reversing the CA's decision, We emphatically ruled that \"(t)here is no more distinction between cases under the RPC (Revised Penal Code) and those covered by special laws with respect to the interruption of the period of prescription\" and reiterated that the period of prescription is interrupted by the filing of the complaint before the fiscal's office for purposes of preliminary investigation against the accused.\nIn the case at bar, it was clear that the filing of the complaint against the respondent with the Office of the Ombudsman on April 1, 2014 effectively tolled the running of the period of prescription. Thus, the filing of the Information before the Sandiganbayan on March 21, 2017, for unlawful acts allegedly committed on February 14, 2013 to March 20, 2014, is well within the three (3)-year prescriptive period of R.A. No. 7877. The courta quo's reliance on the case ofJadewell v. Judge Nelson Lidua, Sr.,is misplaced.Jadewellpresents a different factual milieu as the issue involved therein was the prescriptive period for violation of a city ordinance, unlike here as well as in thePangilinan and other above-mentioned related cases, where the issue refers to prescription of actions pertaining to violation of a special law. For sure, Jadewell did not abandon the doctrine inPangilinanas the former even acknowledged existing jurisprudence which holds that the filing of complaint with the Office of the City Prosecutor tolls the running of the prescriptive period.\nIt is worth noting that the offense inPanaguiton, i.e.,violation of BP 22, was committed in 1993 when BP 22 was not yet covered by the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure. In 2003, the Supreme Court, through A.M. No. 00-11-01-SC,amended the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure to include within its scope violations of BP 22. Thus, revisiting the rule on the interruption of prescriptive period with respect to special laws and those offenses covered by summary procedure is therefore in order.\nSection 11 of the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure states that:\nSECTION 11.How Commenced.The filing of criminal cases falling within the scope of this Rule shall be either by complaint or by information: Provided, however, that in Metropolitan Manila and in Chartered Cities, such cases shall be commenced only by information, except when the offense cannot be prosecutedde oficio.\nThe complaint or information shall be accompanied by the affidavits of the complainant and of his witnesses in such number of copies as there are accused plus two (2) copies for the court's files. If this requirement is not complied with within five (5) days from date of filing, the case may be dismissed. (Emphasis supplied)\nPatently, the phrase \"without need of a prior preliminary examination or preliminary investigation\" found in Sec. 9 of the 1983 Rules on Summary Procedure is now deleted in the above-quoted provision.Jadewelldeclared that \"[a]s provided in the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, only the filing of an Information tolls the prescriptive period where the crime charged is involved in an ordinance.\"Notably, the offense involved inJadewellis a violation of city ordinance which, as provided in the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, is commenced only by information except when the offense cannot be prosecutedde oficio.\nIn other words, in Metropolitan Manila and in Chartered Cities, prescriptive period is tolled only by the filing of an Information in court and not by the commencement of a preliminary investigation by the investigating body nor the institution of the complaint with the investigating body. Other than Metropolitan Manila and Chartered Cities, the criminal action is commenced by filing a complaint or information before the court. In the same vein, the running of the prescriptive period is interrupted by either the complaint or information filed in court.\nHence, for special laws within the scope of the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, the principle laid down inZaldiviaandJadewellis controlling, i.e. violations of municipal or city ordinance, and BP 22. Accordingly, the ruling inPanaguitonwith respect to interruption of prescription of BP 22 shall govern only those acts committed when BP 22 is not yet covered by the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure,i.e.before the effectivity of A.M. No. 00-11-01-SC on April 15, 2003. Thus, for acts committed on April 15, 2003 onwards, the filing of complaint or information in court shall interrupt the running of the prescriptive period and not the institution of the preliminary investigation by investigating agencies or the filing of a complaint before such investigating agencies. However, in Metropolitan Manila and Chartered Cities, only the filing of Information in court shall toll the running of the prescriptive period.\nAs to other special laws not covered by the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, such as a violation of RA 3019, the rule is that the prescriptive period is interrupted by the institution of proceedings for preliminary investigation. Plainly, the ruling laid down inPerezandPangilinan,as well as the justification elucidated inPanaguiton,are relevant and appropriate in the case at bar.\nHence, the filing of the instant complaint against respondents with the Office of the Ombudsman in 1990 effectively tolled the running of the prescriptive period. From the reckoning point,i.e.1986, only four years have lapsed when the Republic filed the Complaint in 1990 against respondents. Clearly, respondents' alleged violation of RA 3019 has not yet prescribed.\nMoreover, the Complaint filed before the Ombudsman interrupted the running of the prescriptive period. The respondents cannot, therefore, argue that the offense has already prescribed on the basis of the absence of Information filed with the Sandiganbayan.\nOmbudsman committed grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed the Complaint based on prescription of offense\nAs a general rule, the Court cannot interfere with the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause without violating the latter's constitutionally-granted investigatory and prosecutorial powers. Sec. 15 of RA 6770, otherwise known asThe Ombudsman Act,provides for the powers, functions and duties of the Office of the Ombudsman, to wit:\nSECTION 15.Powers, Functions and Duties. The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions and duties:\n(1) Investigate and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient. It has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by theSandiganbayanand, in the exercise of this primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigatory agency of Government, the investigation of such cases;\n(2) Direct, upon complaint or at its own instance, any officer or employee of the Government, or of any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, as well as any government-owned or controlled corporations with original charter, to perform and expedite any act or duty required by law, or to stop, prevent, and correct any abuse or impropriety in the performance of duties;\n(3) Direct the officer concerned to take appropriate action against a public officer or employee at fault or who neglect to perform an act or discharge a duty required by law, and recommend his removal, suspension, demotion, fine, censure, or prosecution, and ensure compliance therewith; or enforce its disciplinary authority as provided in Section 21 of this Act:Provided,That the refusal by any officer without just cause to comply with an order of the Ombudsman to remove, suspend, demote, fine, censure, or prosecute an officer or employee who is at fault or who neglects to perform an act or discharge a duty required by law shall be a ground for disciplinary action against said officer;\n(4) Direct the officer concerned, in any appropriate case, and subject to such limitations as it may provide in its rules of procedure, to furnish it with copies of documents relating to contracts or transactions entered into by his\/[her] office involving the disbursement or use of public funds or properties, and report any irregularity to the Commission on Audit for appropriate action;\n(5) Request any government agency for assistance and information necessary in the discharge of its responsibilities, and to examine, if necessary, pertinent records and documents;\n(6) Publicize matters covered by its investigation of the matters mentioned in paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) hereof, when circumstances so warrant and with due prudence:Provided,That the Ombudsman under its rules and regulations may determine what cases may not be made public:Provided, further,That any publicity issued by the Ombudsman shall be balanced, fair and true;\n(7) Determine the causes of inefficiency, red tape, mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the Government, and make recommendations for their elimination and the observance of high standards of ethics and efficiency;\n(8) Administer oaths, issuesubpoenaandsubpoena duces tecum,and take testimony in any investigation or inquiry, including the power to examine and have access to bank accounts and records;\n(9) Punish for contempt in accordance with the Rules of Court and under the same procedure and with the same penalties provided therein;\n(10) Delegate to the Deputies, or its investigators or representatives such authority or duty as shall ensure the effective exercise or performance of the powers, functions, and duties herein or hereinafter provided;\n(11) Investigate and initiate the proper action for the recovery of ill-gotten and\/or unexplained wealth amassed after February 25, 1986 and the prosecution of the parties involved therein.\nThe Ombudsman shall give priority to complaints filed against high ranking government officials and\/or those occupying supervisory positions, complaints involving grave offenses as well as complaints involving large sums of money and\/or properties. (Emphasis supplied)\nInPresidential Ad Hoc Committee on Behest Loans v. Tabasondra,the Court explained the rationale behind the Court's non-interference with the Ombudsman's investigatory and prosecutorial powers, to wit:\nThe Ombudsman has the power to investigate and prosecute any act or omission of a public officer or employee when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.In fact, the Ombudsman has the power to dismiss a complaint without going through a preliminary investigation, since he\/[she] is the proper adjudicator of the question as to the existence of a case warranting the filing of information in court. The Ombudsman has discretion to determine whether a criminal case, given its facts and circumstances, should be filed or not. This is basically his\/[her] prerogative.\nIn recognition of this power, the Court has been consistent not to interfere with the Ombudsman's exercise of his investigatory and prosecutory powers.\nVarious cases held that it is beyond the ambit of this Court to review the exercise of discretion of the Office of the Ombudsman in prosecuting or dismissing a complaint filed before it. Such initiative and independence are inherent in the Ombudsman who, beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and preserver of the integrity of the public service.\nThe rationale underlying the Court's ruling has been explained in numerous cases.The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they would he compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant.In order to insulate the Office of the Ombudsman from outside pressure and improper influence, the Constitution as well as Republic Act No. 6770 saw fit to endow that office with a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutory powers, virtually free from legislative, executive or judicial intervention. If the Ombudsman, using professional judgment, finds the case dismissible, the Court shall respect such findings unless they are tainted with grave abuse of discretion.(Emphasis supplied)\nIt is worth noting that the instant petition is elevated before this Court via Rule 65 to determine whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction when it dismissed Republic's Complaint against respondents based on prescription of offense. To reiterate, the Court generally does not interfere with the Office of Ombudsman in its duty of finding the existence of probable cause nor its decision to dismiss the complaint without undergoing preliminary investigation as in the case at bar which was dismissed by reason of prescription of offense. An exception would be a finding of grave abuse of discretion.\nAs defined inCasing v. Ombudsman,\"[g]rave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. The Ombudsman's exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner  which must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law  in order to exceptionally warrant judicial intervention.\"\nAs extensively discussed, Ombudsman Desierto's approval of the August 6, 1998 Review and Recommendation and the September 25, 1998 Order which recommended the dismissal of the Republic's Complaint based on prescription of offense is so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined, that is, to conduct a preliminary investigation and to determine whether probable cause exists to charge herein respondents with violation of RA 3019. As found by this Court, the dismissal based on prescription of offense is erroneous and inconsistent with applicable law and jurisprudence. Evidently, the Ombudsman should not have dismissed Republic's Complaint based on prescription of offense, and proceeded to determine whether probable cause exists to charge respondents with violation of RA 3019. The OSG should have been given an opportunity to present evidence, and then resolve the case for purposes of preliminary investigation.\nNonetheless, it is premature for this Court to rule on the existence of probable cause and direct the filing of the Information with the Sandiganbayan when the Ombudsman dismissed the complaint not on the non-existence thereof, nor appreciation of the evidence, but on prescription of offense. In other words, this Court cannot rule on whether there is probable cause to indict respondents for violation of RA 3019, without interfering with the Ombudsman's investigatory duty when the same was not even specifically considered as basis for the dismissal of the Republic's Complaint.\nIn addition, this Court will not rule on respondent Concepcion's contention that he should not be charged with violation of RA 3019 as he was merely impleaded in his capacity as a lawyer and not in his own personal capacity. The issue calls for the discretionary power of the Ombudsman to prosecute respondent Concepcion based on his involvement in the alleged anomaly surrounding the MOA dated November 20, 1974.\nBesides, the issue inRegalapertains to respondent Concepcion's alleged involvement as lawyer and partner of ACCRA in relation to the Complaint dated July 31, 1987 filed by the Republic against respondent Cojuangco, Jr. for the recovery of alleged ill-gotten wealth, which includes shares of stocks in the named corporations in SB Civil Case No. 0033 entitledRepublic of the Philippines v. Eduardo Cojuangco.\nSB Civil Case No. 0033 alleged that respondents Concepcion and Cojuangco, Jr. and other defendants therein conspired in setting up, through the use of coconut levy funds, the financial and corporate framework and structures that led to the establishment of UCPB, UNICOM, and through insidious means and machinations, ACCRA, using its wholly-owned investment arm, ACCRA Investments Corporation, became the holder of approximately 15 million shares representing roughly 3.3% of the total capital stock of UCPB as of March 31, 1987.In fine,Regalaexcluded respondent Concepcion and other ACCRA lawyers from SB Civil Case No. 0033 based on the privilege of attorney-client confidentiality, constitutional right against self-incrimination, and equal protection clause.\nOn the other hand, the present criminal case concerns respondent Concepcion's alleged involvement in the MOA dated November 20, 1974 which purportedly violated RA 3019. To reiterate, the duty to prosecute respondent Concepcion is within the discretionary power of Ombudsman based on its own finding of probable cause.\nSpeedy Disposition\nFinally, respondents allege that the delay in the filing of the necessary Information before the Sandiganbayan violated their constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases.\nThe right to speedy disposition of cases is embodied under Sec. 16, Art. III of the Constitution,viz.:\nSection 16. All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies.\nFurthermore, Sec. 12, Art. XI of the Constitution requires the Ombudsman to act promptly on all complaints filed before it:\nSection 12. The Ombudsman and his[\/her] Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public officials or employees of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations, and shall, in appropriate cases, notify the complainants of the action taken and the result thereof.\nAlso, Sec. 13 of RA 6770 mandates the Ombudsman to:\nSection 13.Mandate. The Ombudsman and his[\/her] Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against officers or employees of the government, or of any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations, and enforce their administrative, civil and criminal liability in every case where the evidence warrants in order to promote efficient service by the Government to the people.\nInCagang v. Sandiganbayan(Cagang), there was inordinate delay by the Sandiganbayan in the resolution and termination of preliminary investigation. The Court laid down the guidelines to resolve issues involving the right to speedy disposition of cases, to wit:\nFirst,the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law.The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial.What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.\nSecond,a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation.This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.\nThird,courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof.If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.\nIf the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove first, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and second, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.\nOnce the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.\nFourth,determination of the length of delay is never mechanical. Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised.\nAn exception to this rule is if there is an allegation that the prosecution of the case was solely motivated by malice, such as when the case is politically motivated or when there is continued prosecution despite utter lack of evidence. Malicious intent may be gauged from the behavior of the prosecution throughout the proceedings. If malicious prosecution is properly alleged and substantially proven, the case would automatically be dismissed without need of further analysis of the delay.\nAnother exception would be the waiver of the accused to the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial. If it can be proven that the accused acquiesced to the delay, the constitutional right can no longer be invoked.\nIn all cases of dismissals due to inordinate delay, the causes of the delays must be properly laid out and discussed by the relevant court.\nFifth,the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial must be timely raised.The respondent or the accused must file the appropriate motion upon the lapse of the statutory or procedural periods. Otherwise, they are deemed to have waived their right to speedy disposition of cases.(Emphasis supplied)\nWe applyCagangto the case at bar. The Court finds that respondents Concepcion, Dela Cuesta, Enrile, Ursua, and Pineda's constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases was violated by the Ombudsman through the inordinate delay in concluding the preliminary investigation.\nBelow is a timeline of incidents from the filing of the Complaint:\nBased on this timeline, it is apparent that the preliminary investigation spanned for over eight years. It was only in 1997 that any movement or action on the case actually began.\nCagangemphasizes that it is important to determine who has the burden of proving delay, If the delay is beyond the time periods provided in the rules, then the burden shifts to the State, or in this case, to petitioner Republic.\nHere, respondents argue that their right to speedy disposition of cases was violated by the Ombudsman. To determine whether the delay is inordinate,Caganginstructs the Court to examine whether the Ombudsman followed the specified time periods for the conduct of preliminary investigation.FollowingCagang,the subsequent rulings inJavier v. Sandiganbayan(Javier) andCatamco v. Sandiganbayan(Catamco) emphasized that the Ombudsman rules did not specify time periods to conclude preliminary investigations.Thus, the Court deemed the time periods provided in the Rules of Court to have suppletory application to proceedings before the Ombudsman.\nThe recent case ofLorenzo v. Hon. Sandiganbayan Sixth Division(Lorenzo) involves prosecution for violation of RA 3019. The case ofLorenzostemmed from the alleged anomalous procurement of various quantities of fertilizer (granular urea) from the Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Corporation for the Luzon regions in 2003 by government officials of the Department of Agriculture and National Food Authority.\nInLorenzo,the Court elucidated on the right of speedy disposition of cases by applyingCagang, Javier,andCatamco.Thereafter, this Court found that there was a violation of the constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases when the preliminary investigation spanned four years from the filing of the complaint to the approval of an Order denying a motion for reconsideration.\nWe quote below the discussion inLorenzoand the applicable time periods for fact-finding investigations:\nIn the absence of specific time periods in the Rules of the Ombudsman,JavierandCatamcothus applied Section 3, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that the investigating prosecutor has 10 days after the investigation to determine whether there is sufficient ground to hold the respondent for trial. This 10-day period may appear short or unreasonable from an administrative standpoint. However, as held inAlarilla v. Sandiganbayan (Alarilla), given the Court's duty to balance the right of the State to prosecute violations of its lawvis-à-visthe rights of citizens to speedy disposition of cases, the citizens ought not to be prejudiced by the Ombudsman's failure to provide for particular time periods in its own Rules of Procedure.\nSoon after the promulgation ofJavierandCatamco,the Ombudsman issued Administrative Order No. (A.O.) 1 series of 2020 which specified the time periods in conducting its investigations.\nFor fact-finding Investigations, A.O. 1 provides that \"[u]nless otherwise provided for in a separate issuance, such as an Office Order creating a special panel of investigators and prescribing therein the period for the completion of an investigation, the period for completion of the investigation shall not exceed six (6) months for simple cases and twelve (12) months for complex cases\" subject to considerations on the complexity of the case and the possibility of requesting for extension on justifiable reasons, which shall not exceed one year. Notably, the fact­finding investigation in this case arguably spanned 10 years, or from October 2003 until November 2013 when the Complaint was filed before the Ombudsman, which is clearly beyond the period provided in A.O. 1. Nevertheless, the Court is constrained to disregard this apparent delay following the prevailing doctrine inCagangthat the period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.\nWe reproduce the relevant portions of Administrative Order No. (A.O.) 1, series of 2020on the applicable time periods:\nSection 7.Commencement of Preliminary Investigation. -Without prejudice to the Procedure in Criminal Cases prescribed under Rule II of Administrative Order No. 07, as amended,a preliminary investigation is deemed to commence whenever a verified complaint, grievance or request for assistance is assigned a case docket numberunder any of the following instances:\na) Upon referral by an Ombudsman case evaluator to the preliminary investigation units\/offices of the Office of the Ombudsman, after determining that the verified complaint, grievance or request for assistance is sufficient in form and substance and establishes the existence of aprima faciecase against the respondent\/s; or\nb) At any time before the lapse; of the period for the conduct of a fact­-finding investigation whenever the results thereof support a finding ofprima faciecase.\nIn all instances, the complaint, grievance or request for assistance with an assigned case docket number shall be considered as pending for purposes of issuing an Ombudsman clearance.\nSection 8.Period for the conduct of Preliminary Investigation.- Unless otherwise provided for in a separate issuance, such as an Office Order creating a special panel of investigators\/prosecutors and prescribing the period for completion of the preliminary investigation, the proceedingstherein shall not exceed twelve (12) months for simple cases or twenty-four months (24) months for complex cases,subject to the following considerations:\na) The complexity of the case shall be determined on the basis of factors such as, but not limited to, the number of respondents, the number of offenses charged, the volume of documents, the geographical coverage, and the amount of public funds involved.\nb) Any delay incurred in the proceedings, whenever attributable to the respondent, shall suspend the running of the period for purposes of completing the preliminary investigation.\nc) The period herein prescribed may be extended by written authority of the Ombudsman, or the Overall Deputy Ombudsman\/Special Prosecutor\/Deputy Ombudsman concerned for justifiable reasons, which extension shall not exceed one (1) year.\nSection 9.Termination of Preliminary Investigation. A preliminary investigation shall be deemed terminatedwhen the resolution of the complaint, including any motion for reconsideration filed in relation to the result thereof,as recommended by the Ombudsman investigator\/prosecutor and their immediate supervisors,is approved by the Ombudsmanor the Overall Deputy Ombudsman\/Special Prosecutor\/Deputy Ombudsman concerned. (Emphasis supplied)\nApplying the foregoing to the instant case, preliminary investigation commenced on February 12, 1990 when the Complaint was filed, and terminated on October 9, 1998 when the Ombudsman approved the Order dated September 25, 1998 and denied the Republic's motion for reconsideration. Thus, whether the Court applies the 10-day period in Javier and Catamco, or the more generous periods of 12 to 24 months under A.O. 1, We arrive at the same conclusion that the Ombudsman exceeded the specified period provided for preliminary investigations.\nConsequently, the burden of proof shifted to petitioner Republic. However, petitioner Republic failed to discharge this burden, as petitioner Republic did not establish that the delay was reasonable and justified. In particular, petitioner Republic did not prove that: (1) it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and the prosecution of the case; (2) the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and (3) no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.\nCagangstates that Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised. The Court observes that there is no elucidation in petitioner Republic's pleadings as to what specific issue is too complex or what voluminous records are involved to justify the delay. To be sure, matters not involving complex factual or legal issues should not take long to resolve.1âшphi1\nBy way of exception, if the accused acquiesced to the delay, then the constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases cannot be invoked. As held inPeople v. Sandiganbayan,citingCagang,the invocation of the right to speedy disposition of a case must be timely raised through an appropriate motion; otherwise, the delay would be construed as acquiesced or waived.\nIt is worth noting that not one of the respondents invoked their right to speedy disposition of cases before the Ombudsman during the preliminary investigation stage prior to the issuance of the assailed August 6, 1998 Review and Recommendation and the September 25, 1998 Order as approved by Ombudsman Desierto on August 14, 1998 and October 9, 1998, respectively. However, as respondents, they had no duty to expedite or follow-up the cases against them since there are determined periods for the termination of the preliminary investigation.Thus, the mere inaction on the part of accused, without more, does not qualify as an intelligent waiver of their constitutionally guaranteed right to the speedy disposition of cases.\nIn fact, the earliest opportunity for respondents to invoke their constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases was before this Court in response to the present Petition by the Republic. Among the respondents, Dela Cuesta argued that \"this is the only opportune time for respondent to invoke his right'\"because he was not served a copy of the Petition at the outset. Nonetheless, respondents' failure to invoke their constitutional right is not fatal to their cause.\nAdditionally, the Republic failed to show that petitioners did not suffer any prejudice because of the 8-year delay.Cagang,citingCorpuz v. Sandiganbayan,explains the concept of prejudice, to wit:\nPrejudice should be assessed in the light of the interest of the defendant that the speedy trial was designed to protect, namely: to prevent oppressive pre­trial incarceration; to minimize anxiety and concerns of the accused to trial; and to limit the possibility that his [or her] defense will be impaired. Of these, the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.There is also prejudice if the defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately the events of the distant past. Even if the accused is not imprisoned prior to trial, he is still disadvantaged by restraints on his liberty and by living under a cloud of anxiety, suspicion and often, hostility. His financial resources may be drained, his association is curtailed, and he is subjected to public obloquy.(Emphasis supplied)\nWith this case pending for over 30 years and possibly more without assurance of its resolution, the Court recognizes that the tactical disadvantages carried by the passage of time should be weighed against petitioner Republic and in favor of the respondents.Certainly, if this case were remanded for further proceedings, the already long delay would drag on longer. Memories fade, documents and other exhibits can be lost and vulnerability of those who are tasked to decide increase with the passing of years.In effect, there would be a general inability to mount an effective defense.\nTaken in its entirety, there is a clear violation of the respondents' constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases when petitioner Republic failed to provide sufficient justification for the delay in the termination of the preliminary investigation. Consequently, a dismissal of the case is warranted.\nWhile this Court has no doubt that the Republic had all the resources to pursue cases of corruption and ill-gotten wealth, the inordinate delay in this case may have made the situation worse for respondents.\nAs the Supreme Court, We dutifully exercise cold impartiality while demanding accountability from the government and protecting the rights of all people.\nWHEREFORE, the petition isPARTIALLY GRANTED. Accordingly:\n1. The August 6, 1998 Review and Recommendation and the September 25, 1998 Order in OMB-0-90-2808, as approved by Ombudsman Aniano A. Desierto on August 14, 1998 and October 9, 1998, respectively, areREVERSEDandSET ASIDE;\n2.

{"id":4801,"text":"Manila\nEN BANC\n[ A.M. No. CA-24-002-P (Formerly JIB FPI No. 22-016-CA-P). October 10, 2023 ]\nCOURT OF APPEALS, COMPLAINANT, VS. ROMMEL P. LABITORIA, CLERK II, JUDICIAL RECORDS DIVISION, COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENT.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nSINGH, J.:\nThis case stemmed from a Judicial Integrity Board ( JIB ) Report, dated June 8, 2023, pertaining to the Letter, dated October 20, 2022 of Court of Appeals ( CA ) Presiding Justice Remedios A. Salazar-Fernando, referring the October 14, 2022 Report and Recommendation ( Report ), that recommended Rommel P. Labitoria ( Labitoria ), Clerk II, Judicial Records Division, CA Manila, to be charged with Grave Misconduct for using illegal drugs and\/or substances.\nThe Facts\nOn July 7, 2022, the CA conducted a random drug test facilitated by the Kaiser Medical Center at the CA Auditorium. The drug test was conducted through Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer.\nLabitoria's drug test report revealed the presence of methamphetamine (or shabu ), which was confirmed by the Labtox Analytical Laboratory, Inc.:\nOn August 4, 2022, a Notice of Result of Random Drug Test was sent to Labitoria to challenge the same within fifteen (15) days from notice. Labitoria, however, did not respond.\nOn September 5, 2022, Labitoria, with two other employees, were referred to the Manila Health Department for a drug dependency examination and for further intervention, following Item No. VI of Civil Service Memorandum Circular No. 13, s..\nOn October 5, 2022, a Memorandum was issued directing Labitoria to show cause why no disciplinary action should be taken against him for Grave Misconduct for having been found positive for the use of dangerous drugs in violation of Section 50 (A) (3), Rule 10 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in Civil Service. However, Labitoria, despite receipt, did not submit a response.\nIn his Report and Recommendation, dated October 14, 2022, Atty. Arnel Macapagal recommended that Labitoria be formally charged with Grave Misconduct, albeit his first offense, for being found positive for the use of dangerous drugs, and for the case to be indorsed to the JIB. The Report stated that the confirmatory Drug Test Report became final when he failed to prepare a challenge test and his silence on the show cause memorandum constituted more than prima facie evidence for the charge.\nThe JIB, in a 1st Indorsement dated December 5, 2022, directed Labitoria to comment on the charges against him.\nLabitoria, in his Comment, dated December 12, 2022, admitted using illegal drugs sometime in May 2022 when he attended a birthday celebration in Nueva Vizcaya. He averred that he was convinced to try the illegal substance to keep him alert on the drive back to Manila. He expressed deep remorse and promised not to engage in said act again. He likewise stated that he had been undergoing the required rehabilitation and has yielded two (2) consecutive negative results since. He appealed to the Court stating that he has been in government service since 1994, as a Clerk II at the First Level Court, an Emergency Laborer at the Commission on Elections since 2007, and Clerk II at the Judicial Records Division of the Court of Appeals since 2012, and prayed that these be considered as mitigating circumstances together with his candid admission of fault and sincere promise to improve his ways.\nThe Report and Recommendation of the JIB\nIn his Report and Recommendation, JIB Acting Executive Director Atty. James D.V. Navarette recommended, among others, that Labitoria be found guilty of Grave Misconduct and be dismissed from the service. The JIB adopted and approved the factual findings of the Acting Executive Director with modification, as follows:\nA. The instant administrative case be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter against respondent Rommel P. Labitoria, Clerk II, Judicial Records Division, Court of Appeals, Manila; and\nB. Respondent Rommel P. Labitoria be found guilty of Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances and be dismissed from the service with prejudice to re-employment in any government agency, including government-owned or controlled corporations, and with forfeiture of retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits.\nThe Issue\nShould Labitoria be administratively charged for possession and\/or use of illegal drugs or substances?\nThe Ruling of the Court\nThe Court adopts and approves the recommendation of the JIB with modification.\nMisconduct is the transgression of some established or definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, unlawful behavior, willful in character, improper or wrong behavior. The misconduct, however, becomes a grave offense if it involves any of the additional elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rules, which must be established by substantial evidence.\nIn In Re: Administrative Charge of Misconduct Relative to the Alleged Use of Prohibited Drug of Reynard B. Castor, the Court ruled that a flagrant violation of Republic Act ( R.A. ) No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, satisfies the requisites of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, and\/or wanton disregard of established rules in order to categorize such misconduct as grave in nature and warrant the erring employee's dismissal from the service.\nRule 140, Section 14 (o) of the Rules of Court ( Rule 140 ), as amended, provides possession and\/or use of illegal drugs or substances as a serious charge. Serious charges are sanctioned under Section 17 of Rule 140:\nSection 17. Sanctions. \n(1) If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:\n(a) Dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits.\n(b) Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than six (6) months but not exceeding one (1) year; or\n(c) A fine of more than ₱100,000. but not exceeding ₱200,000..\nLabitoria, who stubbornly ignored previous directives to respond to the notice to challenge and show cause order from the CA, eventually admitted to using illegal drugs in May 2022. That he was \"convinced\" to take these to stay awake as he drove back home does not absolve him from administrative liability.\nJurisprudence stresses that the image of a court of justice is mirrored in the conduct, official, and otherwise, of the personnel who work thereat. Court personnel have been enjoined to adhere to the exacting standards of morality and decency in their professional and private conduct in order to preserve the good name and integrity of the courts of justice. In In Re: Special Report on the Arrest of Rogelio M. Salazar, Jr., Sheriff IV, Regional Trial Court  Office of the Clerk of Court, Boac, Marinduque, for violation of Republic Act No. 9165, the Court reminded that \"all members and employees of the Judiciary are expected to adhere strictly to the laws of the land, one of which is [R.A. No. 9165] which prohibits the use of dangerous drugs. . . .\"\n[T]he conduct of a person serving the judiciary must, at all times, be characterized by propriety and decorum and above all else, be above suspicion so as to earn and keep the respect of the public for the judiciary. The Court would never countenance any conduct, act or omission on the part of all those in the administration of justice, which will violate the norm of public accountability and diminish or even just tend to diminish the faith of the people in the judiciary.\"\nThe Court has, in previous cases, dismissed court employees for testing positive for taking prohibited drugs, and whose benefits were forfeited.\nIn the 2021 case of Re: Alleged Smoking and Possible Drug Use of Louie Mark U. De Guzman ( De Guzman ), the Court dismissed the respondent from the service after he tested positive for the use of marijuana by a drug test administered by the National Bureau of Investigation, and by his own admission, the Court reiterated the sanctions meted to every government official or employee found positive for the use of dangerous drugs under the Civil Service Commission rules:\nAlso, it is provided under Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 13, Series of 2010, that any official or employee found positive for use of dangerous drugs shall be subjected to disciplinary\/administrative proceedings with a penalty of dismissal from the service at first offense pursuant to Section 46 (b) (19), Chapter 7, Book V of Executive Order No. 292 and Section 22 (c), Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 and Other Pertinent Civil Service Laws.\nThe Court nevertheless directed De Guzman to be referred to a suitable drug rehabilitation facility where he may be able to undertake programs for his rehabilitation at his own expense.\nHere, without a doubt, Labitoria's use of prohibited drugs violated the norms of conduct for public service, committing conduct unbecoming of court personnel, and tarnishing the very image and integrity of the Judiciary. As correctly found by the JIB, Labitoria is guilty of Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances, sanctioned as a serious charge under Rule 140, Section 14.\nHowever, the Court finds it proper to modify the imposable penalty recommended by the JIB.\nThe Court notes that Labitoria underwent and completed the mandatory drug rehabilitation, alleging that he has yielded two (2) consecutive negative results since, and has spent thirty-one (31) years in government service. The Court likewise takes note that Labitoria has another administrative case for Habitual Tardiness pending before the Court.\nOn April 18, 2023, the Court En Banc approved A.M. No. 23-02-11-SC or the Guidelines for the Implementation of a Drug-Free Policy in the Philippine Judiciary ( Guidelines ), that took effect on September 17, 2023. These Guidelines reaffirm R.A. No. 9165, Section 2, which mandates that it is the State's policy to provide effective mechanisms or measures to reintegrate into society individuals who have fallen victim to drug abuse or dependence through sustainable treatment and rehabilitation programs.\nSection 6 of the Guidelines provides the following administrative liabilities for court employees:\nSECTION 6. Administrative Liability.\nA. Court Employees\ni. A positive confirmatory result or challenge test result for drug use, except as provided under Section 7, shall constitute as basis for an administrative charge of Possession and\/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substance, which is considered a serious charge under Section 14(o) of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. 21-08-09-SC (Rule 140).\nii. The following acts shall also constitute Gross Misconduct under Section 14 (a) of Rule 140:\n1. Tampering with any result of a drug test;\n2. Interfering in the conduct of the drug test or in the release of drug test results; and\n3. Refusing to undergo or complete their treatment or rehabilitation as provided under Section 8 hereof, once found positive for use of dangerous drugs.\niii. The failure of a court employee, without a valid reason, to undergo mandatory drug testing after being randomly selected under Section 5(D) shall constitute Gross Insubordination under Section 14(n) of Rule 140.\niv. The procedure under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court shall govern the institution of administrative proceedings under these Guidelines.\n. . . 1aшphi1\nSECTION 7. Voluntary Submission. \nThe DFWC of the SC, CA, SB, CTA, or OCA, as the case may be, shall provide a mechanism for court employees to willingly submit themselves, of their own volition, for the treatment and rehabilitation of existing drug-taking habits. Voluntary submission for drug testing may be done any time prior to the date of the random drug testing as may be fixed by the DFWC. This notwithstanding, the procedure for the conduct of drug testing under the voluntary submission mechanism shall follow Section 5 (D) and (E) in this Guidelines.\nThe Court expresses grave concern for the biopsychosocial effects of drug abuse and acknowledges that drug abuse is a public health challenge best addressed by employing effective practices in implementing a drug-free policy in the Judiciary. Rather than being seen as a mere criminal issue, drug abuse should be as it is now internationally viewed as a complex health disorder that is preventable and treatable. 1aшphi1 Thus, the Court must strike a balance between imposing administrative sanctions for the Serious Charge of Using Prohibited Drugs and Substances without diminishing the high standards imposed on all members of the Judiciary, across all ranks.\nConsidering that this is Labitoria's first offense, his thirty-one (31) years in government service, and his completed drug rehabilitation program, testing negative for the use of drugs two consecutive times, the Court finds these mitigating circumstances applicable to impose the lower penalty of suspension for one (1) year, in lieu of the recommended dismissal from the service, pursuant to Section 20 Rule 140.\nACCORDINGLY, the present administrative case is RE-DOCKETED as a regular administrative matter against respondent Rommel P. Labitoria, Clerk II, Judicial Records Division, Court of Appeals, Manila.\nThe Court finds the respondent Rommel P. Labitoria GUILTY of Possession and\/or Use of Illegal Drugs or Substances, a serious charge under Section 14(o) of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. 21-08-09-SC and orders his SUSPENSION from office without salary and other benefits for one (1) year. He is STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of a similar violation will be dealt with the penalty of dismissal from service. This Resolution is immediately executory.\nThe Supreme Court Medical and Dental Services is directed to refer Rommel P. Labitoria to a suitable drug rehabilitation facility where he may be able to undertake programs for his continued rehabilitation during the period of his suspension, at his own expense.\nSO ORDERED.\nGesmundo, C.J., Leonen, SAJ., Caguioa, Hernando, Inting, Zalameda, M.

{"id":4803,"text":"Manila\nTHIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 260912, August 30, 2023 ]\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nSINGH, J.:\nBefore this Court is a Motion for Reconsideration ( Motion ), dated January 19, 2023, filed by petitioner Department of Energy ( DOE ) of the Court's Decision, dated August 17, 2022, which denied DOE's Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision, dated November 4, 2021, and the Resolution, dated May 24, 2022, of the Court of Tax Appeals ( CTA ) En banc, in CTA EB No. 2241 (CTA Case No. 10198). The said CTA En banc Decision and Resolution dismissed the petition for review filed by DOE against the Warrants of Distraint and\/or Levy and Garnishment issued by the respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue ( CIR ), for lack of jurisdiction over the dispute involving two national government agencies, namely, the DOE and the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ).\nWhile a motion for reconsideration, by its nature, may tend to dwell on issues already resolved in the decision or resolution sought to be reconsidered, a circumstance which should not be an obstacle for a reconsideration, petitioners must still raise matters substantially plausible or compellingly persuasive to warrant a reversal of the Court's previous ruling. However, the DOE failed to do so.\nOn December 7, 2018, the BIR issued a Preliminary Assessment Notice ( PAN ) for deficiency excise taxes amounting to ₱18,378,759,473. to the DOE. The DOE was given 15 days to pay the deficiency taxes. On December 17, 2018 or 10 days after the issuance of the PAN, the BIR issued a Formal Letter of Demand or a Final Assessment Notice ( FLD\/FAN ) for the assessed amount.\nOn December 21, 2018, the DOE replied to the BIR and asserted that it is not liable for the assessed amount because it is not an \"owner, lessee, concessionaire or operator of the mining claim\" liable to pay excise taxes under Section 130(A)(1) of the National Internal Revenue Code ( NIRC ). The DOE posits that it is an agency which merely grants mining rights or service contracts on behalf of the State. The DOE further contends that the subject transactions involve condensates, which are classified as liquified natural gas and as such, are exempt from excise taxes under Item 3. of BIR Revenue Regulations No. 1-2018, dated January 5, 2018.\nOn July 17, 2019, the BIR informed the DOE that the assessment has become final, executory and demandable. According to the BIR, the DOE failed to file a formal protest on the FLD\/FAN within the 30-day period prescribed under existing revenue rules and regulations. The BIR likewise informed the DOE that, as confirmed by the Department of Science and Technology, condensates are separate and distinct from natural gas, which is exempt from excise tax.\nOn July 31, 2019, the DOE replied that it has not yet received FLD\/FAN and that, based on its records, the only document or communication it received from the BIR since December 2018 was the PAN.\nThis notwithstanding, on September 19, 2019, the BIR issued the assailed Warrants of Distraint and\/or Levy and Garnishment. This prompted the DOE to write a letter, which the BIR received on October 8, 2019, recounting the exchanges between the two agencies and reiterating that it has yet to received a FLD\/FAN, which reckons the period to file a protest. The DOE thus claims that the BIR's premature actions deprived it of due process.\nThe DOE then reasserts its claims that condensates are exempt from excise tax and that it is not one of the persons liable for excise taxes.\nOn October 18, 2019, there being no other recourse from the assailed BIR warrants, the DOE filed a Petition for Review (with Urgent Motion for Suspension of Collection of Taxes) before the CTA.\nOn November 8, 2019, the CTA Second Division dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Citing the Court's ruling in PSALM v. CIR ( PSALM ), the CTA Second Division ruled that the CTA is not the proper forum to resolve what it characterized as a purely intra-governmental dispute. The DOE filed its motion for reconsideration, but on January 30, 2020, it was denied for lack of merit.\nConsequently, on February 21, 2020, the BIR filed a Money Claim with the Commission on Audit ( COA ) for the assessed deficiency excise tax amounting to ₱18,378,759,473., citing the finality of its assessment against the DOE. It was discovered in the proceedings before the COA that the FLD\/FAN was indeed served on the DOE, but not through its Records Management Division, which is the DOE's centralized receiving and releasing unit for all communications. The FLD\/FAN was served through one of the DOE' s employees, who was claimed to be unauthorized to receive the same. Consequently, the document was not routed properly and remained unknown to the concerned officials of the agency until the BIR alluded to the same in subsequent communications.\nOn February 28, 2020, the DOE filed a Petition for Review before the CTA En Banc. On November 4, 2021, the CTA En Banc affirmed the Division's Resolutions dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction. On May 24, 2022, the CTA En Banc denied the DOE's Motion for Reconsideration.\nThus, on June 9, 2022, the DOE filed a Petition for Review under Rule 45 before the Court.\nOn August 17, 2022, the Court denied the Petition and affirmed the ruling of the CTA En Banc, finding that all disputes, claims, and controversies, solely or among executive agencies, including disputes on tax assessments, must perforce be submitted to administrative settlement by the Secretary of Justice or the Solicitor General, as the case may be.\nOn January 19, 2023, the DOE filed a Motion for Reconsideration. 1aшphi1 It submits that: (1) the case falls squarely under the appellate jurisdiction of the CTA over disputed assessments of the CIR, pursuant to Section 4 of the NIRC; (2) the PSALM case is not applicable because it involved the enforcement of a Memorandum of Agreement among PSALM, BIR and the National Power Corporation ( NPC ) relative to the payment of the alleged deficiency value-added tax out of the NPC's sale of two power plants, while the present case involves disputed assessments and a violation of due process; (3) the warrants issued are void ab initio for BIR's failure to observe due process of law when it issued the FLD\/FAN prior to the expiration of 15-day period given to the DOE to respond to the PAN and when it irregularly served the FLD\/FAN; and (4) condensates are not subject to excise tax and the DOE is not an owner of a mining claim, therefore, it is not liable to pay excise tax.\nAs earlier pronounced, the Motion must be denied for failing to raise any substantial argument to justify a reversal of the Court's August 17, 2022 Decision.\nIn this case, the Motion is a mere reiteration of the arguments raised in the Petition, which DOE previously pleaded. The DOE mainly asserts the inapplicability of the Court's ruling in PSALM:\n9. To reiterate, there was neither a decision nor inaction on a disputed assessment, refund of internal revenue taxes, nor violation of due process of law in the PSALM case. Rather, the actions of the parties were governed by the MOA entered into. Accordingly, PSALM could not have sought recouse with the CTA, even if it wanted to, as the CTA could have no jurisdiction over the same. Hence, with the execution of the MOA and in accordance with its terms, CIR and PSALM voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction, power and authority of the DOJ.\n10. That is not the situation involved in the instant case where the cause of action of the petitioner is hinged upon a law, specifically Section 7(a)(1) of RA 1125, as amended by RA 9282 and RA 9503 (CTA Law), on the application of the CTA's \"other matters\" jurisdiction, a law not even considered and discussed with much weight in PSALM. Hence, absent any agreement between or among the parties on the voluntary submission of tax issues to the DOJ, the default provision on CTA's exclusive jurisdiction should preval.\nThe Court first clarifies that the Motion erringly cites a different case title and number for the PSALM case. Instead of PSALM v. CIR, promulgated in 2017 by the Court sitting En Banc, the DOE cited PSALM v. CA, which although promulgated in the same year, was decided by the Court's Third Division.\nAt any rate, a closer look at the PSALM case reveals that while the facts of the present Petition are different, as PSALM does not involve any disputed assessment by CIR, the doctrine in PSALM harmonizing a general law and a special law still applies. The Court in PSALM explained:\nFurthermore, it should be noted that the 1997 NIRC is a general law governing the imposition of national internal revenue taxes, fees, and charges. On the other hand, PD 242 is a special law that applies only to disputes involving solely government offices, agencies, or instrumentalities.\nApplying the foregoing by analogy, Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, is the general law governing the appellate jurisdiction of the CTA, which include resolving disputed assessments, that apply equally to all persons involving disputes pertaining to all tax claims arising from all tax laws being implemented by the BIR. On the other hand, Presidential Decree ( P.D. ) No. 242 is the special law governing all disputes exclusively between government agencies, offices and instrumentalities, arising from the interpretation and application of statutes, particularly Section 130(A)(1) of the NIRC and Item 3. of BIR Revenue Regulations No. 1-2018, dated January 5, 2018.\nBeing an administrative dispute or a dispute involving two agencies of the Executive Branch of government, the authority to resolve the same vested by P.D. No. 242 upon the President of the Philippines is well within its power of control. Moreover, disputes between or among agencies or offices of the Executive Department requires an understanding of how their different and competing mandates and goals affect one another, a function that is also within the President's expertise as Chief Executive. As explained in the Decision, P.D. No. 242 highlights the practical considerations of administrative settlement to avoid clogging the court dockets and avoid wasting government resources where the ultimately the only party involved is the Government.\nFinally, the Court rejects DOE's invocation of the higher interest of substantial justice. The Court has emphasized that jurisdiction is a matter of substantive law and is conferred by the Constitution or the law. Thus, the mere invocation of substantial justice does not automatically suspend the application of the rules, especially when what it seeks to alter is a matter of jurisdiction. 1aшphi1\nFor failing to raise matters compellingly persuasive to warrant the reconsideration of the assailed Resolution, the Motion is denied.\nACCORDINGLY, the Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED .

MARIA, BULACAN, PETITIONERS, VS. CARLOS A. BUENAVENTURA, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nGAERLAN, J.:\nBefore the Court is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to annul and set aside the Decision dated October 26, 2009, of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 90850, and its Resolution dated February 2, 2010, denying the motion for reconsideration thereof. The assailed decision granted the respondent's appeal and set aside the Decision dated September 18, 2007, of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 14, in Civil Case No. 766-M-2002.\nAntecedents\nOn October 11, 2002, the respondent filed a complaint for sum of money and damages against the petitioners Municipality of Sta. Maria Bulacan, its then Mayor Bartolome R. Ramos (Mayor Ramos), and the Municipal Members of the Sangguniang Bayan (SB) of Sta. Maria, Bulacan (collectively, petitioners). In his Complaint, the respondent alleged that he is the registered owner of a parcel of land located at Barangay Guyong, Sta. Maria, Bulacan, consisting of an area of 17,102 square meters and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-61427(M) of the Registry of Deeds of the Province of Bulacan. He claimed that without his knowledge and consent, the petitioners took possession and constructed a road on approximately 998. square meters of the subject property. Upon discovery thereof, the respondent wrote to Mayor Ramos demanding the removal of the constructed road.\nSubsequently, meetings were held between the respondent and Mayor Ramos which led to a draft memorandum of agreement (MOA) in which the respondent agreed to allow the petitioners to use the subject portion of his property until 2004; thereafter, the petitioners committed to return the property to the respondent in its original condition. The draft MOA was submitted to the SB of Sta. Maria for approval. However, after deliberations, the petitioner SB, found the draft MOA beneficial only for the respondent. Thus, in Kapasiyahan Bilang 2002-112 dated August 26, 2002, it refused to give authority to Mayor Ramos to sign the same. This prompted the respondent to file the instant complaint, in which he prayed among others, for the payment of reasonable rent from the time the road was constructed until the same is restored to its original condition and returned to him.\nIn response, the petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss in lieu of an Answer. The petitioners argued that the complaint has no cause of action as the land in which the road was constructed belongs to Barangay Guyong, Sta. Maria, Bulacan by virtue of a Deed of Donation executed by the respondent in the latter's favor.\nTheir motion having been denied by the RTC in its Order dated August 8, 2003, the petitioners filed an Answer in which they affirmed that they are uncertain as to whether the portion in which the road was constructed belongs to the respondent and that, at any rate, the construction was undertaken only upon prior knowledge that the property was donated in favor of Barangay Guyong.\nAfter trial, on September 18, 2007, the RTC rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the Dismissal of the complaint.\nCosts against plaintiff.\nSO ORDERED.\nIn its decision, the RTC held that the notarized Deed of Donation which has the respondent's signature is a public document and as such is admissible without further proof of its authenticity and is entitled to full faith and credit. 1aшphi1 The RTC adjudged that the Deed of Donation is deemed valid until annulled in a proceeding specifically lodged for the purpose, not the one before it which is a case for sum of money and damages. Accordingly, it held that the petitioners acted in good faith in relying upon the Deed of Donation as the basis for its construction on the subject property and are not liable for damages.\nAggrieved, the respondent then filed an appeal before the CA which rendered the herein assailed Decision on October 26, 2009, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the instant appeal is hereby granted. Accordingly, the decision of the court a quo dated September 18, 2007 is perforce reversed. Judgment is hereby rendered ordering the [petitioners] at their own expense, to remove and demolish the subject road and restore it to its original condition. Moreover, the [petitioners] are adjudged to pay the [respondent] as and by way of rentals at the rate of P2,000. per month commencing in June 2001 until said illegally constructed road is removed and returned to the latter, and the costs of suit.\nSO ORDERED.\nIn resolving the appeal in favor of the respondent, the CA ruled that the burden rests upon the party who asserts the truth of a fact. In this case, the CA held that it is incumbent upon the petitioners to prove that the subject property on which the construction was made is the same portion that is the subject of the Deed of Donation which the respondent allegedly executed in favor of Barangay Guyong and that the respondent's signature in the document is authentic.\nThe CA adjudged that the petitioners failed to discharge the burden of proof. In contrast, the CA found that the respondent was able to present convincing evidence that his signature in the Deed was forged particularly when the same is held in comparison with that in the verification\/certification portion of the Complaint.\nTherefore, having established that the Deed of Donation was forged, the CA held that the respondent is entitled to the removal of the construction, compensation for use of his land, and damages pursuant to Article 449 of the New Civil Code. Nevertheless, the CA denied the respondent's claim for rentals in the amount of ₱25,000. ratiocinating that the same partakes of the nature of actual damages which must be supported by proof. In the absence of proof or agreement as to the amount of monthly rentals, the CA awarded in favor of the respondent temperate damages in the amount of P2,000. per month computed from the time he has been removed from possession thereof and prevented to the use of the subject property. The CA similarly denied the respondent's claim for moral damages, litigation expenses, and attorney's fees for lack of basis.\nThe petitioners sought a reconsideration of the said decision, but the CA denied it in its Resolution dated February 2, 2010.\nIn the instant petition, the petitioners submit the following issues for the Court's disposition:\nI. Whether or not the notarized Deed of Donation being a public document is considered valid until nullified in a separate and proper proceeding;\nII. Whether or not the burden of proof lies on the petitioners that the Deed of Donation is not a forgery. 1âшphi1\nIII. Whether or not [the] petitioner municipality is in bad faith for constructing a road over the property covered by a notarized deed of donation and consequently pay rentals for its use.\nSuccinctly, the Court is tasked to resolve whether or not the subject Deed of Donation is valid and sufficient to support the petitioners' construction on the subject premises.\nRuling of the Court\nThe petition is partly meritorious.\nIn gist, the instant Petition invites the Court to make a determination as to the authenticity of the respondent's signature in the deed of donation. Forgery is an issue that is essentially factual in nature, and as such beyond the province of the instant petition for review on certiorari which is limited to errors of law. However, the rule is not absolute and admits of exceptions. In the case at bar, as the findings of fact of the CA are contrary to those of the RTC, the Court may review the records and evidence anew in resolving this appeal.\nAs a rule, forgery cannot be presumed. It must be proved by clear, positive, and convincing evidence. The burden rests upon the party alleging forgery to prove his or her case by preponderance of evidence.\nForgery can be established by a visual comparison between the alleged forged signature and the authentic and genuine signature of the person whose signature is theorized to have been forged. On this matter, the opinion of handwriting experts is not conclusive upon the courts, particularly when \"the question involved is mere handwriting similarity or dissimilarity, which can be determined by a visual comparison of specimens of the questioned signatures with those of the currently existing ones.\" In determining whether there has been forgery, the judge is not bound to rely upon the testimonies of handwriting experts. The judge must conduct an independent examination of the questioned signature to arrive at a reasonable conclusion as to its authenticity.\nIn this case, the Court agrees with the conclusion of the CA that the respondent's signature on the deed is a forgery. The respondent established by preponderance of evidence that his signature on the instrument is a forgery, viz. :\nFirstly, by the bare look on the signature of the [respondent] as found in the verification\/certification portion of his complaint vis-à-vis his signature appearing on the questioned Deed of Donation, one would show patent and distinct dissimilarities thereof; and secondly, the [Kapasiyahan] Bilang 2002-112 dated August 26, 2002 supported the [respondent's] claim that [Mayor Ramos'] had agreed, among others, to remove the subject road, restore the place to its original condition and return the portion utilized to the former immediately after the year 2004. Otherwise, if [Mayor Ramos] had no such agreement with the [respondent] there was no rhyme and reason at all why the said [kapasiyahan] should have been passed, which in effect, disapproved the authority of the Mayor to sign the said agreement.\nIndeed, a simple visual examination and comparison of the specimen signatures of the respondent in the Verification and Certification of his Complaint as well as of his letter of demand to Mayor Ramos dated May 14, 2002, with that in the subject Deed of Donation, clearly reveals that they are not one in the same and have been affixed by different persons. The petitioner did not submit any countervailing evidence, thus, based on the weight of evidence presented, the Court is more inclined to rule on the respondent's favor. Moreover, the execution and the terms of the Kapasiyahan is an implied recognition of the respondent's ownership over the subject portion of the property. Otherwise stated, there would not be any need for the passing of Kapasiyahan, if the subject portion had indeed been donated in favor of Barangay Guyong.\nHaving concluded that the donation is ineffectual as the respondent's signature therein is forged and spurious, the Court now determines the rights of the respondent.\nIn this case, it is indubitable that there is taking of the respondent's property by the petitioner. Guided by the recent pronouncement by the Court in the fairly similar case of Heirs of Spouses Mariano, et al. v. City of Naga, recovery of possession may no longer be had as the return of the subject property is no longer feasible as a road has already been constructed thereon. Thus, in the higher interest of justice, in order to prevent irreparable injury that may result if the subject property were to be surrendered and the public would be prevented from having access to the road, payment of just compensation is warranted under the premises reckoned from the time of taking on April 11, 2002, the date when the petitioner took possession and constructed a road on the respondent's property. Further, as it is established that the petitioner illegally took over the property, the former must pay the respondent the amount of Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (₱300,000.) as exemplary damages. As the respondent was constrained to litigate to protect his interest, an award of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (₱75,000.) is fair and reasonable under the premises.\nWHEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing disquisitions, the Decision dated October 26, 2009 and Resolution dated February 2, 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 90850, are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION S, in that:\n1. the order for the petitioners to remove and demolish the subject road and restore it to its original condition is hereby DELETED;\n2. the award of monthly rental in favor of the respondent is likewise DELETED;\n3. the petitioners are ORDERED to pay the respondent just compensation equivalent to the fair market value of the property at the time of taking on April 11, 2002, with legal interest thereon at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum until full payment; and\n4. the petitioners are ORDERED to pay the respondent exemplary damages in the amount of Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (₱300,000.) and attorney's fees of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (₱75,000.).\nFinally, the case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 14, for the determination of just compensation, which is hereby DIRECTED to resolve the instant case with dispatch.\nSO ORDERED.\nCaguioa (Chairperson), Inting, Zalameda, and Singh, JJ., concur.\n","label":[[24,39,"CASE_NUM"],[41,55,"PROM_DATE"],[58,93,"INS"],[101,116,"PERSON"],[136,176,"INS"],[195,217,"PERSON"],[322,329,"STA"],[337,351,"STA"],[402,418,"PROM_DATE"],[427,443,"INS"],[452,472,"CASE_NUM"],[679,699,"INS"],[741,766,"CASE_NUM"],[887,921,"INS"],[938,956,"PERSON"],[980,1022,"INS"],[1184,1199,"INS"],[1366,1385,"INS"],[1727,1732,"PERSON"],[2270,2275,"PERSON"],[2734,2749,"INS"],[2892,2895,"INS"],[3219,3234,"INS"],[3276,3279,"INS"],[3507,3510,"INS"],[3732,3735,"INS"],[5902,5916,"STA"],[7898,7901,"INS"],[9765,9770,"PERSON"],[10184,10189,"PERSON"],[10562,10573,"INS"],[10737,10748,"INS"],[10809,10824,"INS"],[11136,11141,"INS"],[12296,12312,"INS"],[12316,12336,"CASE_NUM"],[13087,13107,"INS"],[13270,13277,"PERSON"],[13293,13299,"PERSON"],[13301,13309,"PERSON"],[13315,13325,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

PANEM, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nINTING, J.:\nThe Court resolves the administrative complaint that Flordelina Ascaño (Ascaño) filed against respondent Atty. Mario V. Panem (Atty. Panem) before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for alleged violations of Administrative Matter No. 02-8-13-SC, or the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (Notarial Rules), and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).\nThe Antecedents\nIn the complaint, Ascaño alleged that Atty. Panem notarized a Deed of Absolute Sale (Deed) in favor of Spouses Severino and Matilde Guillermo (Spouses Guillermo) involving a property she owned in Sto. Domingo, Ilocos Sur, without her presence as the supposed seller thereof. Ascaño recounted that when she confronted Atty. Panem about it, he volunteered to handle the case in order to get the property back from Spouses Guillermo. Initially, Ascaño accepted Atty. Panem's offer, but she later learned that the latter did not adhere to her narration of facts when he filed the action in court on her behalf.\nAs a result, Ascaño filed the present administrative case against Atty. Panem for violation of the Notarial Rules when he: (1) notarized the Deed without the presence of one of the parties; (2) failed to ask for a competent evidence of identity before notarizing the document; and (3) failed to submit his notarial register for the period 2006-2007. She also charged Atty. Panem with representing conflicting interests in breach of the CPR.\nIn his defense, Atty. Panem countered that Ascaño, who presented her community tax certificate as evidence of her identity, actually signed the Deed in his presence. He explained that his notarial register and all notarial documents were destroyed because his law office was flooded in July 2006. Finally, he argued that he was not guilty of representing conflicting interests considering that he only represented Ascaño in the civil action concerning the property in question.\nReport and Recommendation of the IBP\nIn the Report and Recommendation dated June 28, 2019, the Investigating Commissioner found Atty. Panem guilty of violating the Notarial Rules and the CPR and recommended that he be disbarred from the practice of law.\nThen, in the Resolution No. CBD-2021-05-11 dated May 8, 2021, the IBP Board of Governors adopted the findings of the Investigating Commissioner, but it recommended the following penalties instead of disbarment: (a) suspension from the practice of law for two (2) years; (b) immediate revocation of notarial commission, if still subsisting; and (c) disqualification from reappointment as a notary public for two (2) years. 1aшphi1\nThe Issue\nThe issue for the Court's resolution is whether Atty. Panem should be held administratively liable for his actions.\nThe Court's Ruling\nAfter a careful review, the Court adopts and approves the findings and recommendations of the IBP with modifications as to the designation of the offenses committed by Atty. Panem and the penalty to be imposed upon him, in view of A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, or the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), which repealed the CPR and took effect on May 29, 2023.\nTo note, Section 1 of the General Provisions of the CPRA provides for the Code's applicability to all pending and future cases, except in instances where \"in the opinion of the Supreme Court, its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case, the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.\" Here, the Court deems the application of the CPRA, in conjunction with the Notarial Rules, to be proper in determining the administrative liabilities of Atty. Panem.\nSection 1, Rule II of the Notarial Rules requires the affiant's personal appearance and the notary public's examination of his or her competent evidence of identity in relation to the notarization of a document, viz. :\nSection. 1. Acknowledgment. - \"Acknowledgment\" refers to an act in which an individual on a single occasion:\n(a) appears in person before the notary public and presents an integrally complete instrument or document;\n(b) is attested to be personally known to the notary public or identified by the notary public through competent evidence of identity as defined by these Rules; and\n(c) represents to the notary public that the signature on the instrument or document was voluntarily affixed by him for the purposes stated in the instrument or document, declares that he has executed the instrument or document as his free and voluntary act and deed, and, if he acts in a particular representative capacity, that he has the authority to sign in that capacity. (Italics supplied.)\nMoreover, Section 12, Rule II of the Notarial Rules defines a \"competent evidence of identity\" as follows:\nSection 12. Competent Evidence of Identity. - The phrase competent evidence of identity\" refers to the identification of an individual based on:\n(a) at least one current identification document issued by an official agency bearing the photograph and signature of the individual, such as but not limited to, passport. driver's license, Professional Regulations Commission ID, National Bureau of Investigation clearance, police clearance, postal ID, voter's ID, Barangay certification, Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS) e-card, Social Security System (SSS) card, Philhealth card, senior citizen card, Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) ID, OFW ID, seaman's book, alien certificate of registration\/immigrant certificate of registration, government office ID, certification from the National Council for the Welfare of Disabled Persons (NCWDP), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) certification; or\n(b) the oath or affirmation of one credible witness not privy to the instrument, document or transaction who is personally known to the notary public and who personally knows the individual, or of two credible witnesses neither of whom is privy to the instrument, document or transaction who each personally knows the individual and shows to the notary public documentary identification. (Italics supplied.)\nThus, a notary public is prohibited from notarizing a document if the person involved as a signatory thereto is: (i) not present at the time of notarization; and\/or (ii) not personally known to or otherwise identified by the notary public through a competent evidence of identity as defined above.\nIn the case, Ascaño vehemently denied ever appearing before Atty. Panem during the questioned notarial act in Ilocos Sur, asserting that she was staying with her daughter in Bulacan at the time. On this point, the Investigating Commissioner noted that Atty. Panem did not submit his notarial register in order to prove his defense that Ascaño actually appeared before him to have the Deed notarized. While Atty. Panem tried to explain that his notarial register was lost because of flooding in his law office in July 2006, the Court simply cannot give any credence to this excuse because of the lack of sufficient evidence to support it.\nIndeed, \"[i]f the document or instrument does not appear in the notarial records and there is no copy of it therein, doubt is engendered that the document or instrument was not really notarized, so that it is not a public document and cannot bolster any claim made based on this document.\"\nEven assuming arguendo that Ascaño truly appeared before Atty. Panem, the record shows that the latter failed to require her to present a competent evidence of identity for the notarization of the contested Deed. In particular, the document shows that Ascaño supposedly presented her community tax certificate to Atty. Panem, which is not considered as a valid and competent evidence of identity as it does not bear the photograph and signature of the individual.\nIt is also undisputed that Atty. Panem did not submit his notarial report and copies of all notarial documents for the period March 17, 2006 to December 31, 2007 per the Certification dated December 5, 2017 from the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur. This, too, constitutes as a clear violation of Section 2, Rule VI of the Notarial Rules, viz. :\nSection 2. Entries in the Notarial Register. - x x x x\nx x x x\n(h) A certified copy of each month's entries and a duplicate original copy of any instrument acknowledged before the notary public shall, within the first ten (10) days of the month following, be forwarded to the Clerk of Court and shall be under the responsibility of such officer. If there is no entry to certify for the month, the notary shall forward a statement to this effect in lieu of certified copies herein required. (Italics supplied.)\nAs earlier mentioned, the Court finds no merit in Atty. Panem's assertion that a strong typhoon in July 2006 caused the flooding in his law office, which, in turn, destroyed his notarial register and all notarial documents. Not only is this unsubstantiated by evidence, but also, it does not explain Atty. Panem's failure to comply with his duty to submit his notarial report for the months prior to and after the supposed calamity that hit Narvacan, Ilocos Sur in 2006.\nIn view of the above-mentioned violations of the Notarial Rules, the Court likewise holds Atty. Panem liable for breach of Section 2, Canon III of the CPRA, viz. :\nCANON III\nFidelity pertains to a lawyers duty to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the land, to assist in the administration of justice as an officer of the court, and to advance or defend a client's cause, with full devotion, genuine interest, and zeal in the pursuit of truth and justice.\nx x x x\nSection 2. The responsible and accountable lawyer. - A lawyer shall uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land, promote respect for laws and legal processes, safeguard human rights, and at all times advance the honor and integrity of the legal profession.\nThe Court, however, disagrees with the IBP that Atty. Panem is guilty of representing conflicting interests in violation of Section 13, Canon III of the CPRA. After all, ''lawyers are deemed to represent conflicting interests when, in behalf of one client, it is their duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires them to oppose.\" Essentially, this proscription applies to a situation where opposing parties are the lawyer's present and\/or former clients. Here, Atty. Panem is correct that he cannot be held administratively liable for violation of Section 13 because he only represented Ascaño in the civil action and no one else. 1aшphi1\nThis is not to say that Atty. Panem is without any administrative liability in this regard. The records show that in the complaint for reconveyance that he prepared for Ascaño, Atty. Panem made it appear that the latter had signed the Deed in his presence before he notarized the document. Despite Ascaño's demands, Atty. Panem did not amend the complaint in order to adhere to his client's narration of facts. As such, Ascaño was constrained to hire another counsel who, in turn, filed an amended complaint on her behalf.\nMore than that, Atty. Panem clearly acted for his own selfish interests by stating in the pleading that Ascaño personally appeared before him to have the Deed notarized. As the Investigating Commissioner aptly observed, Atty. Panem only offered to represent Ascaño in the civil action to recover the property because he was aware of the mistake he made when he notarized the document in the absence of the seller. Indeed, Atty. Panem's dishonest conduct is evinced by the fact that he changed the narrative against his client's wishes in an obvious attempt to clear himself of any wrongdoing.\nBy knowingly making untruthful statements in a pleading filed in court, Atty. Panem clearly violated Section 2, paragraphs 2 and 3 and Section 6, Canon III as well as Section 1, Canon IV of the CPRA, which provide:\nCANON III\nSection 2. The responsible and accountable lawyer.  x x x\nAs an officer of the court, a lawyer shall uphold the rule of law and conscientiously assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.\nAs an advocate, a lawyer shall represent the client with fidelity and zeal within the bounds of law and the CPRA.\nSection 6. Fiduciary duty of a lawyer.  A lawyer shall be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed by the client. x x x\nCANON IV\nA lawyer professionally handling a client's cause shall, to the best of his or her ability, observe competence, diligence, commitment, and skill consistent with the fiduciary nature of the lawyer-client relationship, regardless of the nature of the legal matter or issues involved, and whether for a fee or pro bono.\nSection 1. Competent, efficient and conscientious service.  A lawyer shall provide legal service that is competent, efficient, and conscientious. A lawyer shall be thorough in research, preparation, and application of the legal knowledge and skills necessary for an engagement.\nMoreover, Atty. Panem likewise breached his duties under the Revised Lawyer's Oath to promote the rule of law and a regime of truth and justice and to do no falsehood both in and out of court.\nThe Proper Penalties\nIt is settled that a notary public who violates the Notarial Rules is meted out with the following penalties: one, revocation of notarial commission, if existing; two, disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public; and three, suspension from the practice of law. Notably, the period of suspension varies depending on the circumstances of each case.\nUnder Section 33(b) and (p), Canon VI of the CPRA, making untruthful statements and violating the Notarial Rules in bad faith, with the exception of reportorial requirements, are both considered as serious offenses and sanctioned under Section 37 (a) of the same Canon as follows:\nSection 37. Sanctions. \n(a) If the respondent is found guilty of a serious offense, any of the following sanctions, or a combination thereof, shall be imposed:\n(1) Disbarment;\n(2) Suspension from the practice of law for a period exceeding six (6) months;\n(3) Revocation of notarial commission and disqualification as notary public for not less than two (2) years; or\n(4) A fine exceeding Php100,000..\nIn relation thereto, Sections 39 and 40, Canon VI of the CPRA provides:\nSection 39. Manner of imposition. - If one (1) or more aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances are present, the Supreme Court may impose the penalties of suspension or fine for a period or amount not exceeding double of the maximum prescribed under this Rule. The Supreme Court may, in its discretion, impose the penalty of disbarment depending on the number and gravity of the aggravating circumstances.\nIf one (1) or more mitigating circumstances and no aggravating circumstances are present, the Supreme Court may impose the penalties of suspension or fine for a period or amount not less than half of the minimum prescribed under the CPRA.\nIf there are both aggravating and mitigating circumstances present, the Supreme Court may offset each other. (Italics supplied.)\nSection 40. Penalty for multiple offenses. \nIf the respondent is found liable for more than one (1) offense arising from separate acts or omissions in a single administrative proceeding, the Court shall impose separate penalties for each offense. Should the aggregate of the imposed penalties exceed five (5) years of suspension from the practice of law or ₱1,000,000. in fines, the respondent may, in the discretion of the Supreme Court, be meted with the penalty of disbarment.\nIf a single act or omission gives rise to more than one (1) offense, the respondent shall still be found liable for all such offenses, but shall, nonetheless, only be meted with the appropriate penalty for the most serious offense. (Italics supplied.)\nNotably, in Ong v. Bijis, the Court found the respondent lawyer administratively liable for notarizing a document without the presence of the affiants and, at the same time, failing to require the parties who actually appeared before him to provide a competent evidence of their identities. Consequently, the Court revoked his notarial commission, disqualified him from being commissioned as a notary public for two (2) years, and suspended him from the practice of law for six (6) months.\nThen, in Lopez v. Mata, et al., the Court held that one of the respondent lawyers failed to comply with his duty as a notary public to submit his notarial report as the Notarial Rules mandated for which he was sanctioned with: (a) suspension from the practice of law for (6) six months; (b) revocation of his incumbent notarial commission; and (c) disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public for two (2) years.\nGiven the factual milieu of the case as well as Atty. Panem's apparent lack of remorse for his actions, he is hereby meted out with the following penalties for each offense he committed pursuant to the above-mentioned provisions of the CPRA:\n(a) For violating the Notarial Rules in bad faith, which is bolstered by his feeble attempts to cover it up after the fact, the Court suspends Atty. Panem from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year, revokes his notarial commission, if existing, and disqualifies him from being commissioned as a notary public for two (2) years; and\n(b) For making untruthful statements, the Court imposes against Atty. Panem a fine in the amount of ₱100,000..\nWHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Mario V. Panem GUILTY of violating A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC, or the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, or the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, and the Revised Lawyers Oath. Accordingly, the Court imposes the following sanctions against him:\n(a) Suspension from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year, revocation of notarial commission, if existing, and disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public for a period of two (2) years, effective immediately, for violation of the 2006 Rules on Notarial Practice; and\n(b) A fine in the amount of ₱100,000. for making untruthful statements in a pleading filed in court.\nThe Court likewise STERNLY WARNS respondent Atty. Mario V. Panem that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.\nThe suspension from the practice of law shall take effect immediately upon receipt of respondent Atty. Mario V. Panem of this Decision. He is DIRECTED to immediately file a Manifestation to the Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel.\nLet copies of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to the personal record of respondent Atty.

GUINGONA, AND JOSEFA TAYKO GUINGONA, RESPONDENTS.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nGAERLAN, J.:\nBefore this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari dated June 22, 2017 filed by petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), seeking to partially annul and set aside the Decision dated June 14, 2016 and the Resolution dated March 29, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 06198.\nThe CA in its assailed Decision, reversed and set aside the Decision dated May 17, 2011 issued by the Regional Trial Court, acting as a Special Agrarian Court (RTC-SAC) of Dumaguete City, Branch 32, in Civil Case No. 2010-14471. The CA affirmed the valuation made by the Regional Adjudication Board, as affirmed by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Adjudication Board (DARAB) pertaining to the 60.-hectare portion of the property planted with corn. However, with respect to the portion of the property planted with sugarcane, the CA remanded the case to the RTC-SAC for the reception of evidence to determine the Annual Gross Production (AGP) and the Capitalized Net Income of the properties following the valuation factors set forth in Section 17 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657.\nFacts\nThe facts of the case are undisputed.\nRespondents are the heirs of the late spouses Josefa Tayko Guingona and Mauro Tayko, who were the owners of an estate planted with sugar, corn, rice, and coconut, situated in Barangay Casalaan, Siaton, Negros Oriental.\nOn January 15, 1995, the landowners offered a portion of their estate covered by TCT Nos. OV-9869, OV-9871, and OV-9875 (collectively, subject properties), with a total area of 481. hectares for voluntary coverage under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), with an offer price of ₱150,000. per hectare.\nThereafter, representatives of LBP, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), and the Barangay Agrarian Reform Committee (BARC) conducted an ocular inspection of the Subject Properties. On June 17, 1997 the ocular inspection team submitted a report recommending the exclusion of 121 hectares of the subject properties. Meanwhile, only 360. hectares of the subject properties were recommended to be subject of CARP coverage consisting of the following: (1) 295. hectares of sugar land; (2) 60. hectares of corn land; and (3) 4. hectares of coco land.\nOn November 26, 1997, LBP received the claim folders for the subject properties. However, the Claims Valuation and Processing Form was prepared almost six years later on May 19, 2003.\nThereafter, LBP prepared a Memorandum of Valuation and Claim Folder Profile & Valuation Summary dated November 25, 2003 covering 360. hectares of the subject properties. LBP valued the subject properties at ₱32,804,751..\nOn December 18, 2003, the preliminary payment in cash and in bonds for the subject prope1iies was deposited and a memorandum of the deposit was annotated on the titles.\nOn December 30, 2003, the certificates of titles in the name of the landowners were cancelled and transfer certificates of title were issued in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.\nRespondents, however, rejected the valuation made by LBP.\nAccordingly, respondents filed a Petition for the Determination and Fixing of Just Compensation before the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (RARAD), which was docketed as RARAD VII-N-1281-1283-2004. The landowners claimed that in valuing their properties, LBP should have used the production data and values at the time of the transmittal of the claim folders to the LBP Head Office in 2003, instead of the data gathered at the time of the ocular inspection in 1997. Thus, the landowners asserted that the just compensation for the subject properties should be fixed at ₱63,738,314., and not ₱32,804,751. as fixed by LBP.\nIn a Resolution dated March 8, 2006, the RARAD agreed with the landowners' valuation of P63,738,314.. LBP then elevated the ruling to the DARAB insisting that the said valuation was not in accord with DAR Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 5, Series of 1998 and DAR-LBP Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No. 15, Series of 1999.\nThe DARAB eventually resolved LBP's appeal in favor of respondents maintaining the valuation made by the RARAD.\nRefusing to concede, LBP eventually filed a Petition for the Final Determination of Just Compensation before the RTC-SAC, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 09-14471.\nThe Ruling of the RTC\nIn its Decision dated May 17, 2011, the RTC-SAC ruled in favor of respondents and fixed the amount of compensation at P143,774,384., the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the Court finds for the Respondent, and hereby DIRECTS the Petitioner Land Bank to pay the following: (1) the remaining balance of the just compensation to the Petitioners in the amount of One Hundred Ten Million Nine Hundred Sixty­ Nine Thousand Six Hundred Thirty-Three and 5\/100 (P110,969,633.) pesos, with legal interest of 12% per annum , reckoned from December 30, 2003 up to the time when the whole amount is actually paid; and (2) its share in the Commissioners' fees in the amount of P200,000.. In addition, Petitioner is hereby ordered to release the total amount of initial deposit in favor of the Respondents for the just compensation of the subject properties in the amount of Thirty-Two Million Eight Hundred Four Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty-One and 62\/100 pesos (P32,804,751.), if the same has not been actually received by the Respondents to date. Finally, respondents are likewise direct to pay its share in the Commissioners' fees in the same amount.\nSO ORDERED.\nLBP then filed a motion for reconsideration, which was eventually denied by the RTC-SAC.\nThereafter, LBP filed a Petition for Review with the CA assailing the Decision of the RTC-SAC.\nThe Ruling of the CA\nIn its Decision dated June 14, 2016, the CA reversed and set aside the Decision of the RTC-SAC and affirmed the valuation of the corn lands made by the DARAB. Meanwhile, the CA remanded the case to the RTC-SAC for the reception of evidence on the AGP and selling price for sugar for crop year 2003-2004. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE , the Petition is hereby PARTLY GRANTED . The Decision dated May 17, 2011 and the Order dated July 6, 2011, of the Regional Trial Court, sitting as Special Agrarian Court are REVERSED and SET ASIDE .\nThis case is hereby REMANDED to the RTC-SAC, Branch 32, Dumaguete City to receive evidence on the AGP of respondents' properties planted to sugarcane and SP for sugar for crop year 2003-2004, to compute the CNI for the said properties based on such data as provided under JMC 15-99 and to make a final valuation of such lands consistent with A.O. 5-98.\nThe Court AFFIRMS the correctness of the valuation made by the Regional Adjudication Board, as affirmed by DARAB, in the total amount of P6,306,786. as just compensation for 60. hectares of the properties of respondents planted to corn.\nPetitioner Land Bank of the Philippines is ORDERED to pay the respondents the remaining balance of the just compensation less the provisional deposit made on December 18, 2003, with legal interest reckoned from December 18, 2003 up to the time the whole amount is actually paid, at the rate of 12% per annum until June 30, 2013 and 6% per annum thereafter.\nRespondents are ORDERED to pay the commissioners' fee of P200,000..\nSO ORDERED. (Emphases in the original)\nAnent the valuation of sugar lands, the CA observed that the parties do not dispute the applicability of the rules and guidelines set forth in A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998 and JMC No. 15, Series of 1999. The issue of the patties boiled down to the applicable production data and values to be used, i.e., whether the valuation of the property should be based on the 1997 data or at the time the property was taken. On this score, the CA discussed that just compensation for expropriated property shall be fixed at the time of taking, referring to that time that the State has deprived the landowner of the use and benefit of the said property, such as when the title thereof has been acquired by the State. In this case, the CA concluded that the time of taking should be reckoned as of December 18, 2003, when the deposit of payment was made by LBP following the rejection by respondents of LBP's initial valuation. However, since the records are bereft of any production data and values corresponding to the said year, the CA ordered a remand of the case for the reception of evidence on the AGP of respondent's sugar farms and selling prices of sugar as of December 18, 2003.\nWith respect to the valuation of corn lands, the CA affirmed the findings and computation of the DARAB fixing its value at P6,309,786..\nFinally, the CA held that the imposition of legal interest is warranted on the difference between the total amount of just compensation and the initial amount made by LBP computed from the time of taking or on December 18, 2003 until fully paid.\nAccordingly, LBP filed a Motion for Reconsideration questioning the foregoing CA Decision, which was eventually denied by the CA in its Resolution dated March 29, 2017.\nHence, the present Petition for Review on Certiorari .\nThe Present Petition\nLBP now comes before this Court partially questioning the CA Decision. LBP does not assail the ruling of the CA remanding the case for the reception of evidence in arriving at the valuation for sugar lands and the imposition of commissioners' fees. However, LBP questions the CA's findings affirming the DARAB valuation of the land planted to corn and the imposition of legal interest. According to LBP, the CA incorrectly affirmed the valuation made by the RARAD, as affirmed by the DARAB, considering that the said valuation used the formula provided for under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27, despite the fact that the acquisition of the subject property was made by the government under R.A. No. 6657.\nThe Ruling of the Court\nI. Just compensation for the land planted to corn should be based on the valuation factors enumerated under R.A. No. 6657 and the relevant DAR formula.\nJust compensation is defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator. The word \"just\" modifies the term compensation, which means that the equivalent to be given for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full, and ample. In determining just compensation a wide range of factors must be considered in approximating the real and full value of a land. As a judicial function, RTC-SA Cs are enjoined to take into full consideration the factors specifically identified by law and implementing rules, which includes guidelines and formulae prescribed by the DAR, issued pursuant to its mandate to implement agrarian reform programs.\nLBP in its petition argued that the CA incorrectly affirmed the RARAD valuation, which was subsequently affirmed by the DARAB when it fixed just compensation for 60. hectares of the property planted to corn in the amount of ₱6,306,786..\nWe find LBP's argument impressed with merit.\nIn the instant case, it is undisputed that the subject properties were acquired by the government under a voluntary offer to sell made by its owners under the CARP. Relatedly, this Court has repeatedly recognized the applicability of R.A. No. 6657 to corn lands subject of agrarian reform Accordingly, the valuation of the subject corn land should be determined pursuant to the valuation factors provided by R.A. No. 6657 and the relevant implementing guidelines and formula, and not under P.D. No. 27.\nThus, as correctly pointed out by LBP, the RARAD\/DARAB improperly made the valuation using the formula in acquisitions made under P.D. No. 27 despite the fact that the subject property was acquired under R.A. No. 6657. The RARAD\/DARAB computed the valuation for the land planted to corn using the formula provided under P.D. No. 27:\nAccordingly, We find that the CA erred in affirming the foregoing valuation considering that it was not in accordance with the valuation factors set forth in R.A. No. 6657.\nWe have held that the exercise of judicial discretion is not unbridled, but must be discharged within the metes and bounds of the law.\nIn this case, the computation of just compensation for the corn land should be guided by the factors enumerated in Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657, which states:\nSection 17. Determination of Just Compensation.  In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors, shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farm workers and by the Government to the property, as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land, shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.\nRelatedly, the DAR issued A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998 to fill in the details and provide a basic formula to operationalize the determination of just compensation pursuant to Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657, to wit:\nII. The following rules and regulations are hereby promulgated to govern the valuation of lands subject of acquisition whether under voluntary offer to sell (VOS) or compulsory acquisition (CA).\nA. There shall be one basic formula for the valuation of lands covered by VOS or CA:\nLV = (CNI x 0.) + (CS x 0.) + (MV x 0.)\nThe above formula shall be used if all three factors are present, relevant and applicable.\nA. When the CS factor is not present and CNI and MV are applicable, the formula shall be:\nLV = (CNI x 0.) + (MV x 0.)\nA. When the CNI factor is not present, and CS and MV are applicable, the formula shall be:\nLV = (CS x 0.) + (MV x 0.)\nA. When both the CS and CNI are not present and only MV is applicable, the formula shall be:\nLV = MV x 2\nAccordingly, the valuation of the corn land and the computation of just compensation therefor should be based on the foregoing formula, taking into account the production data and values at the time of taking.\nII. The time of taking of the subject property\nIn determining just compensation it is imperative to consider the nature and character of the land at the time of taking or the time when the owner was deprived of the use and benefit of the property, such as when title is transferred in the name of the Republic of the Philippines. The time of taking also determines the applicable DAR administrative order to serve as a guideline for the determination of just compensation.\nIn the instant case, the certificates of titles in the name of the landowners were cancelled and transfer certificates of title were issued in the name of the Republic of the Philippines on December 30, 2003.\nAccordingly, the just compensation for both sugar land and corn land should be valued at the time of taking on December 30, 2003.\nIII. A remand of the case is warranted given the foregoing findings\nIn view of the foregoing disquisitions, the just compensation for the subject lands should be computed based on the valuation factors set forth in Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 and the guidelines and formula under DAR A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998 using the production data and values as of the time of taking, on December 30, 2003.\nAfter a careful review of the records of the instant case, this Court cannot determine just compensation in accordance with the foregoing factors. We, likewise, cannot adhere to the preliminary determination of just compensation made by LBP, as it does not reckon its computation based on the time of taking.\nAccordingly, since the final determination of just compensation is a judicial function, the reception of evidence is necessary to establish and prove the facts and figures to be used in determining just compensation.\nAs this Court is not a trier of facts, We are, thus, constrained to remand the case to the RTC-SAC to determine just compensation, guided by this Court's discussion and strictly in accordance with Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 and applicable DAR regulations, in particular, DAR A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998.\nIV. Imposable Interest\nJust compensation entails not only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to the owners of the land, but also payment within a reasonable time from its taking. When property is taken, full compensation of its value must immediately be paid to achieve a fair exchange for the property and the potential income lost.\nThus, this Court has upheld the imposition of legal interest in expropriation cases where there is delay in the payment since the just compensation due to the landowners was deemed to be an effective forbearance on the part of the State. This is in order to eradicate the issue of the constant variability of the value of the currency over time, and to compensate the owner for the loss of income due to the taking, the imposition of interest is only just and proper.\nHowever, interest shall be imposed only on the unpaid balance of the just compensation, which pertains to the difference between the final amount as properly adjudged by the court in accordance with the applicable DAR issuance and the initial provisional deposit made by the government.\nAccordingly, in line with jurisprudence, legal interest shall be fixed at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the time of taking, which in this case was on December 30, 2003, until June 30, 2013. Afterwards, or beginning July 1, 2013, until finality of this Resolution, just compensation shall earn interest at the new legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum , applying prospectively Section 1 of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  Monetary Board Circular No. 799, Series of 2013.\nThereafter, the total amount of just compensation shall earn legal interest at six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Resolution until its full payment.\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari dated June 22, 2017 filed by petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines is PARTIALLY GRANTED .

{"id":6045,"text":"Cagayan De Oro\nSECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 232169, March 08, 2023 ]\nREPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS, PETITIONER, VS. CASIMIRO TAMPARONG, JR., RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nLOPEZ, M., J.:\nWhat more injustice can be caused to landowners who, up to the time of their death, were not able to fully enjoy the benefits of the land taken from them by the government than to shortchange them with the delay in the payment of just compensation.\nBefore this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision dated May 30, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 06537-MIN, which affirmed the Order dated June 25, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City (RTC), Branch 20 (RTC, Br. 20) in Civil Case No. 99-074, fixing the interest rate to be included in the just compensation at 12% per annum.\nThis case stemmed from the expropriation proceedings initiated by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) through a Complaint filed on February 2, 1999, subject of which was a 7,555-square meter portion of a parcel of land in Barangay Kauswagan, Cagayan de Oro City, owned by Casimiro Tamparong, Jr. (Tamparong). The property was to be used for the Cagayan de Oro Third Bridge and Approaches project of the DPWH.\nOn November 27, 2000, the RTC, Branch 24 (RTC, Br. 24) issued an Order of Expropriation, declaring the Republic of the Philippines' (Republic) lawful right to take the property sought to be expropriated for public use or purpose. On November 29, 2000, the RTC, Br. 24 issued an Order to immediately place the Republic in possession of the property. Years of laborious hearings and exchange of pleadings, however, ensued for the determination of the just compensation. Eventually, the RTC, Br. 20 put to rest the issue on the proper just compensation in its Resolution dated January 21, 2010 as follows:\nWHEREFORE, x x x [the Republic] is hereby directed\/ordered to pay [Tamparong] the just compensation of [PHP] 3,500. [per square] meter multiplied by [the] 7. [square] meter lot subject to the provisions of the Court Order dated December 18, 2008 wherein [the Republic] had already paid the amount of [PHP] 9,443,750. as provisional deposit. The payment shall involve the amount fixed in the judgment and shall include legal interest from the taking of possession of the property until payment is made ([Section] 10[,] Rule 67, Rules of Court; Benguet Consolidated vs. Republic [,] [G.R. No.] 712412[,] August 15, 1986[,] 43 SCRA 467)[.]\nSO ORDERED. (Emphasis supplied)\nNo motion for reconsideration or appeal was filed; hence, the Resolution dated January 21, 2010 became final and executory. The Resolution, however, did not conclude the proceedings between the parties. Controversy on the computation of the remaining balance arose at the execution stage. A Writ of Execution was issued on March 7, 2013, indicating PHP 27,651,129. as the remaining amount to be paid to Tamparong. The amount was based on the computation submitted by Tamparong in his Motion for Execution of Judgment. Upon the Republic's motion for clarification of the amount to be executed, an Amended Writ of Execution was issued on September 13, 2013, which deleted the exact amount previously indicated, and merely echoed the disposition in the Resolution dated January 21, 2010:\nNOW THEREFORE, you are hereby commanded to cause the [REPUBLIC] to pay [TAMPARONG] the just compensation of [PHP] 3,500 [per square meter] x 7,555 [square meters] deducting the amount of [PHP] 9,443,750. as provisional deposit, the payment shall involve (he amount fixed in the Judgment and shall include legal interest from taking of possession of property until payment is made. (Emphasis supplied)\nThereafter, in a letter dated January 13, 2014, the DPWH communicated to Tamparong's counsel, Atty. Joseph M. Baduel (Atty. Baduel), its own computation of the remaining balance to be executed, which included interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of the taking of the property and 12% per annum from the finality of judgment until December 11, 2013.\nAtty. Baduel responded through a letter dated February 18, 2014, requesting for the immediate payment of the remaining balance as stated in the DPWH computation, subject to the adjustment of the interest imposed up to the actual date of the full satisfaction since the computed amount was based on the supposition that it was already satisfied by December 11, 2013. It is noteworthy that the request for immediate payment was due to his client's advanced age (over 80 years old at that time) and medical condition. Payment, however, remained undelivered.\nOn March 5, 2014, Tamparong, through counsel, filed a Motion for Recomputation, asking the RTC, Br. 20 to direct the DPWH to come up with a new computation, which includes interest at the rate of 12%, not 6%, per annum from the time of the taking of the property to conform with prevailing jurisprudence. In an Order dated June 25, 2014, the RTC, Br. 20 ruled:\n[C]onsidering that the [Republic] has been delayed in the payment of the just compensation of the property subject of this expropriation proceedings, the Court hereby ordered that the legal interest is thus fixed at 12% per annum and hereby orders the [Republic] to pay [Tamparong] the amount of the just compensation reckoned from the date of resolution of the Court dated January 21, 2010 at 12% interest rate per annum less the amount already paid and received by [Tamparong]. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe Republic moved for reconsideration, arguing that the 12% legal interest is imposed only \"in the nature of damages for delay in payment\" of the just compensation. The Republic claimed that there was no such delay in this case considering that it had already made substantial provisional payments. Hence, it posited that the imposition of the legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum was unwarranted. The Motion for Reconsideration was denied in an Order dated August 26, 2014, prompting the Republic to file a Petition for Certiorari before the CA with the same argument that there was no delay in the payment of just compensation because provisional payments were made.\nIn its assailed Decision, the CA found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC, Br. 20 in imposing legal interest at the rate of 12% from the taking of the property until full satisfaction. Hence, this Petition, which reiterates the Republic's claim that there was no basis to impose the legal interest of 12% as there was no delay in the payment of the just compensation in view of the provisional payments made. The Republic insinuates that the delay is attributable to Tamparong's refusal to accept the remaining balance computed by the DPWH with his conformity when immediate payment was requested by his counsel. Hence, the Republic impels the Court to direct Tamparong to accept payment in the exact amount stated in the DPWH computation.\nTamparong, on the other hand, imputes bad faith upon the DPWH for giving a computation which is not in accord with jurisprudence on the proper interest to be imposed in just compensation cases. Tamparong explains that he may have initially acceded to the 6% interest in the DPWH computation, but it was only because he was \"already 89 years old, sickly and bedridden,\" wanting to enjoy the fruits of his property. Since the balance remains unpaid, Tamparong now insists on the imposition of the proper interest rate, i.e., 12%, not 6%, per annum from the time of the taking of the property. Tamparong adds that the Republic ought to know the prevailing rule on the matter considering the number of expropriation cases it has dealt with in the past.\nSynthesized from the foregoing arguments, the pivotal issue is whether the imposition of 12% legal interest was justified.\nWe answer in the affirmative.\nSection 9, Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that \"[n]o property shall be taken for public use without just compensation.\" This presupposes that the condemnor incurs delay if it does not pay the landowner the full amount of just compensation on the date of the taking. Ideally, thus, just compensation means full payment of the value of the property immediately upon its taking. However, the determination of just compensation is determined judicially, which more often than not, takes time after the government had already taken possession of the property. Consequently, in the interim, the property owner suffers, not only the deprivation of their land, but also its use, fruits, or income. To remedy the impasse, applicable laws or rules on expropriation require a provisional payment upon the date of the taking or the filing of the complaint. The difference then between the court-determined final amount and the provisional payment incurs legal interest in line with the constitutional mandate on eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness, otherwise, the compensation would not be \"just.\"\nIn Republic v. CA, we underscored the need for the prompt payment of just compensation, including the payment of interest to compensate for any delay in giving full payment for the land already taken. We ruled:\nThe constitutional limitation of \"just compensation\" is considered to be the sum equivalent to the market value of the property, broadly described to be the price fixed by the seller in open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal action and competition or the fair value of the property as between one who receives, and one who desires to sell, i[f] fixed at the time of the actual taking by the government. Thus, if property is taken for public use before compensation is deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the case, the final compensation must include interests on its just value to be computed from the time the property is taken to the time when compensation is actually paid or deposited with the court. In fine, between the taking of the property and the actual payment, legal interests accrue in order to place the owner in a position as good as (but not better than) the position he was in before the taking occurred. (Emphasis supplied)\nIt is undisputed that Tamparong has not yet been fully paid his just compensation because the parties are still in disagreement as to the proper computation of the remaining balance. For this reason, Tamparong is entitled to the legal interest on the unpaid balance. In Evergreen Manufacturing Corporation v. Republic, we emphatically ruled that:\nThe Government's initial payment of just compensation does not excuse it from avoiding payment of interest on the difference between the adjudged amount of just compensation and the initial payment.\nThe initial payment scheme as a prerequisite for the issuance of the writ of possession under [Republic Act (RA) No.] 8974 only provides the Government flexibility to immediately take the property for public purpose or public use pending the court's final determination of just compensation. Section 4 (a) of RA [No.] 8974 only addresses the Government's need to immediately enter the privately[-]owned property in order to avoid delay in the implementation of national infrastructure projects.\nOtherwise, Section 4 of RA [No.] 8974 would be repugnant to Section 9, Article [III] of the 1987 Constitution which mandates that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. To reiterate, the Constitution commands the Government to pay the property owner no less than the full and fair equivalent of the property from the date of the taking. (Emphasis supplied)\nAs to the proper interest rate to be imposed, we have explained that the interest involved in just compensation cases is not consensual in nature, or that stipulated in signed agreements between contracting parties. The interest to which the landowner is entitled \"runs as a matter of law and follows as a matter of course from the right of the landowner to be placed in as good a position as money can accomplish as of the date of the taking.\" We have decisively ruled that:\n[T]he delay in the payment of just compensation is a forbearance of money and, as such, is necessarily entitled to earn interest. Thus, the difference between the final amount as adjudged by the Court, x x x and the initial payment made by the government x x x  which is part and parcel of the just compensation due to the property owner  should earn legal interest as a forbearance of money. x x x [W]ith respect to the amount of interest on this difference between the initial payment and the final amount of just compensation, as adjudged by the Court, we have upheld, in recent pronouncements, the imposition of 12% interest rate from the time of the taking, when the property owner was deprived of the property, until July 1, 2013, when the legal interest on loans and forbearance of money was reduced from 12% to 6% per annum by [the] Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas [BSP] Circular No. 799. Accordingly, from July 1, 2013 onwards, the legal interest on the difference between the final amount and initial payment is 6% per annum. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe Court has consistently applied these rates in expropriation cases, and the Republic did not give us any compelling reason to depart from the established rule.\nAt this juncture, we stress that the delayed full payment cannot be blamed on Tamparong only because he insists on the computation of the remaining balance based on prevailing jurisprudence. Rather, it is the Republic's intransigence that caused the delay, warranting the imposition of legal interest.\nFirst. The DPWH gave Tamparong a specious computation. At first blush, the letter to which the DPWH computation was attached would seem to embody the final and executory judgment of the RTC, Br. 20 on the proper amount of just compensation. A careful scrutiny, however, proves otherwise. The DPWH letter is reproduced below for proper context:\nRE: Full Payment of Just Compensation in Civil Case No. 99-074 (Republic of the Philippines vs Casimiro Tamparong Jr. for Expropriation)\nSir:\nPursuant to the judgment dated January 21, 2010, rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 20 and the subsequent issuance of the Amended Writ of Execution on September 13, 2013, attached herewith is a revised copy of our computation as stated in the Statement of Payment as of December 11, 2013 for the full payment of just compensation for the above-titled case.\nWe would like to advise you that per our computation, the remaining amount payable for just compensation as of December 11, 2013 is SEVENTEEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY[-]THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY[-]SIX AND 76\/100 (PHP 17,253,596.) PESOS. Kindly signify your conformity and approval by signing on the space provided below the Statement of Payment and return the same to us at the soonest possible time. (Emphasis supplied)\nApparently, the computation in the Statement of Payment signified that it is in accord with the RTC, Br. 20's ruling. However, the remaining balance computed by the DPWH included interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the time of the taking of the property. This is inconsistent with the RTC, Br. 20 Resolution dated January 21, 2010 and the Amended Writ of Execution, which ordered the imposition of legal interest. The prevailing legal interest at that time was 12%, not 6%. It was only on July 1, 2013 when the legal interest rate was reduced to 6% under BSP Circular No. 799. Moreover, the DPWH computed interest only up to December 11, 2013, but the award required imposition of legal interest from the taking of the possession of the property until full payment is made. 1aшphi1\nSecond. Desperate to get paid, Tamparong agreed to accept without reservation the offer of the DPWH to put an end to the protracted proceedings considering his age and frail medical condition. The CA Resolution dated August 3, 2016 thus ordered the referral to the Philippine Mediation Center (PMC):\nOn March 2, 2016, [Tamparong], through his counsel, filed a motion for early resolution considering that he is already 89 years old, sickly[,] and bedridden.\nOn May 19, 2016, [the CA] received a Manifestation filed by [Tamparong], informing that he now accepts, without reservation the offer of [the Republic] in the amount of [PHP] 17,253,596. representing the balance due to settle the full amount of just compensation. He further requests for the immediate payment of the aforementioned amount.\nIn view of [Tamparong's] acceptance of the monetary offer of [the Republic], let this case be referred to the Philippine Mediation Center (PMC), the soonest possible time. The PMC is hereby directed to issue the Notice to Appear directly to the parties.\nThe mediator shall endeavor to complete the mediation proceedings within 30 days from the date of the initial mediation proceedings. The Mediator is hereby directed to submit to the [CA] a report on the result of the proceedings at the end of the mediation period. If mediation is successful, the Mediator shall forthwith submit to [the CA] the original Compromise Agreement entered into by the parties or alternatively, in the appropriate case, a satisfaction of claim or withdrawal of appeal. Such agreement shall be the basis for the rendition of a decision based on the parties' compromise agreement, which may be enforced by execution or may result in the dismissal of the appeal. (Emphases supplied)\nDespite the court order, no compromise agreement was reached. The Republic offered no explanation for its refusal to settle in the amount it has consistently invoked, i.e., PHP 17,253,596.. Meanwhile, the unfortunate denouement came about: Tamparong succumbed to death on December 3, 2018 and still remained unpaid his rightful compensation for more than 22 years now. What more injustice can be caused to Tamparong as a landowner who, up to the time of his death, was not able to fully enjoy the benefits of the land taken from him by the government than to shortchange him with the delay in the payment of just compensation. 1aшphi1 Time, indeed, is costly to squander. Delays, justified or otherwise, have irreversible consequences.\nAll given, the RTC, Br. 20, as affirmed by the CA, did not err or gravely abuse its discretion in fixing the interest to be included in the just compensation at the prevailing legal rate of 12% per annum from the taking of the property. Applying the prevailing jurisprudential rules, however, we clarify that the 12% interest should be imposed upon the unpaid balance from the taking of the property, i.e., upon the issuance of the Order immediately placing the Republic in possession of the property on November 29, 2000 until June 30, 2013 only. Thereafter, or from July 1, 2013 until full payment, the legal interest is reduced to 6% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED . The Decision dated May 30, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

{"id":6046,"text":"Manila\nSECOND DIVISION\n[ A.C. No. 13559 [Formerly CBD Case No. 14-4205]. March 13, 2023 ]\nKANG TAE SIK, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ALEX Y. TAN AND ATTY. ROBERTO S. FEDERIS, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nLAZARO-JAVIER, J.:\nThe Case\nComplainant Kang Tae Sik (complainant) charged respondents Atty. Alex Y. Tan (Atty. Tan) and Atty. Roberto S. Federis (Atty. Federis) with violations of Canon 15, Rule 15. and Canon 17 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) for double-dealing and for filing complaints against their client.\nAntecedents\nComplainant is a Korean national engaged in the importation of Korean goods in the Philippines. He engaged Atty. Tan's firm, A. Tan, Zoleta & Associates Law Firm (firm), as his retained counsel and entrusted them with information regarding his personal life and business, among others. He also authorized them to deal with his problems in courts and several government agencies like the Bureau of Customs (BOC), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID) and to settle troubles with his Korean business associates. In exchange for their services, he paid the firm hundreds of thousands of pesos upon Atty. Tan's demand.\nThe firm represented him in the following cases: (1) Criminal Case No. 94-133989-90 involving violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 13 of Manila City ( Manila Case ) for which he paid PHP 200,000. as professional fee; (2) Criminal Case No. 46356 involving violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 before the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 69 of Pasig City ( First Pasig Case ) where Atty. Tan and his associates entered their appearance and filed a motion to revive case; and (3) Civil Case No. 7230 involving a complaint for sum of money against him before Regional Trial Court, Branch 157 of Pasig City ( Second Pasig Case ) for which he paid PHP 300,000. as fees.\nThe firm however deliberately neglected these cases. On one occasion, they made him sign documents that he did not understand but which turned out to be a Withdrawal of Appearance. As such, after only a year, the firm withdrew its appearance in both Pasig Cases. Atty. Tan and his associates' intentional neglect was part of a ploy to obtain information from these cases which they used to blackmail him.\nOn April 21, 2014, he received an order from the BID to file a counter-affidavit vis-à-vis a letter-complaint filed by Atty. Tan positing that he (complainant) violated immigration laws and was convicted for two counts of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 in the Manila Case. Attached thereto was another letter signed by Atty. Federis which was filed with the NBI using the letterhead \"Roberto S. Federis, attorney-at-law,\" albeit Atty. Federis' name still appeared as one of the associates of A. Tan, Zoleta & Associates Law Firm. These letter-complaints, however, were groundless since the warrant of arrest and hold departure order against him which were mentioned therein had already been lifted.\nAtty. Tan and Atty. Federis used information acquired during their lawyer-client relationship, such as the records in the Manila case, to circulate letters maligning his person within the Korean community. Too, they used the same to file the deportation case before the NBI, in violation of their duties under the CPR. More, after gaining mastery of his business operations, respondents established a similar business which directly competes with his own. They filed the letter-complaints to blackmail and eliminate him as a business competitor since they are now the counsel of rival businesses.\nComplainant presented copies of the letter-complaints filed by respondents, relevant pleadings in the Manila and Pasig Cases including respondents' entries of appearance and motions to withdraw appearance, handwritten acknowledgment of the PHP 200,000. fee by Atty. Tan, certifications that the hold departure order against complainant had been lifted, and Articles of Incorporation of L&K Beverage listing Atty. Tan as one of its stockholders.\nRespondents countered that they did not represent complainant in the Manila Case. His counsel therein were Atty. Redentor S. Viaje (Atty. Viaje) and Atty. Aguedo Gepte III who were not affiliated with A. Tan, Zoleta & Associates Law Firm. The firm was engaged to handle the First Pasig Case only 11 years after complainant had already been convicted in the Manila Case.\nContrary to the charges, Atty. Tan's firm was hired to represent complainant only in two of the four cases that were endorsed to the firm for which he was paid PHP 200,000. or PHP 50,000. acceptance fee for each case. As for him (Atty. Tan), he represented complainant only in the First Pasig Case. His engagement therein lasted only for two years because complainant advised him to withdraw therefrom as he (complainant) allegedly had an NBI friend who could help him in criminal cases. At any rate, his withdrawal of appearance was with complainant's full consent.\nIt is not true that he was complainant's business consultant who assisted with the latter's matters involving the NBI, BID, and BOC, nor did complainant disclose his past criminal conviction or other cases except the First Pasig Case. After the termination of the firm's engagement, he no longer maintained communication with complainant. In fact, he already forgot his name and only recalled him as a former client when the present disbarment case was filed against him.\nIn September 2013, he was invited by Mr. Kevin Lee (Mr. Lee), another Korean national, to incorporate L&K Beverage Corporation, which was appointed by Lotte Chilsung, one of the largest beverage manufacturers in Seoul, Korea, as its sole distributor in the Philippines of a popular wine in Korea, Chumchurum sojo. They eventually discovered, however, that complainant, through his NBI friends, initiated an NBI investigation on their shipments, alleging undervaluation thereof.\nComplainant is known for harassing business competitors and even caused some of them to be deported. Atty. Tan received life-threatening text messages from him, which prompted him to report complainant to the NBI and the Philippine National Police and to file a deportation case against him. His allegations therein were supported by records in the Manila Case which were public records.\nIn any case, Atty. Tan maintains he is not guilty of violating the CPR since his duty to a former client does not extend to transactions beyond his engagement. He is not required to protect the client's interest after the lawyer-client relationship has been terminated. In the same vein, conflict of interest only arises if the lawyer used confidential information, which was acquired during the engagement, against his client while their relationship is subsisting. 1aшphi1 At any rate, the rule on \"conflicted interest\" prescribes in five years. It has been 18 years since complainant's conviction. Finally, he was only discharging his duty to report any violation of immigration laws when he filed the letter-complaint.\nRespondents offered as evidence copies of relevant pleadings in the cases involving complainant and the NBI investigations.\nOn May 6, 2015, Atty. Tan informed the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) that Atty. Federis had passed away in April 2015. He was thus dropped from the case.\nReport and Recommendation of the IBP\nInitially, both the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline and Board of Governors (BOG) recommended the dismissal of the complaint. They essentially found that complainant failed to prove that the Manila Case, which was used as basis to file the NBI letter-complaints, was among those handled by Atty. Tan during the firm's engagement. In any case, nine years had already passed since complainant was convicted, and seven years since the deportation complaints were filed. 1aшphi1\nOn complainant's Motion for Reconsideration, the IBP BOG reversed and recommended that Atty. Tan be suspended from the practice of law for six months. Under its Extended Resolution dated June 2, 2022, it explained that Atty. Tan violated the proscription against conflict of interest when he filed the deportation complaints against his former client, complainant, by using information and documents entrusted to his firm by virtue of their lawyer-client relationship.\nIssue\nDid Atty. Tan violate the proscription against conflict of interest?\nRuling\nWe dismiss the complaint for lack of merit.\nCanon 17 of the CPR states:\nCANON 17  A lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client and he shall be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed upon him.\nThe relationship between a lawyer and client is strictly personal and highly confidential and fiduciary. In engaging the services of an attorney, the client reposes upon him or her special powers of trust and confidence. The relation is of such delicate, exacting and confidential nature that is required by necessity and public interest. Only then can the public be encouraged to entrust their confidence in lawyers. Thus, the duty of a lawyer to preserve his or her client's secrets and confidences outlasts the termination of an attorney-client relationship.\nAs such, the CPR prohibits lawyers from representing interests that conflict with that of his or her client. Rule 15. of Canon 15 of the CPR provides, viz. :\nCANON 15  A lawyer shall observe candor, fairness and loyalty in all his dealings and transactions with his clients.\nxxx\nRule 15.  A lawyer shall not represent conflicting interests except by written consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts.\nThis rule against conflict of interest applies even if the relation of lawyer-client had already been terminated and covers not only cases in which confidential communications have been confided, but also those in which no confidence has been bestowed or will be used. The rule holds even if the inconsistency is remote, merely probable, or the lawyer has acted in good faith and with no intention to represent conflicting interests.\nOn this score, Atty. Tan's argument that his duty of fidelity to clients only subsists while the lawyer-client relationship has not yet been terminated, thus, fails. To stress, the proscription against conflict of interest and inviolability of client confidences are equally-binding as regards former clients, in keeping with the highly fiduciary nature of attorney-client relations.\nToo, his argument that the rule against conflict of interest prescribes in five years is misplaced. The case he cited as basis, PCGG v. Sandiganbayan, pertained to the duration of prohibition against retired or separated lawyers in government service from taking part in cases involving matters they handled in their former government positions. In fine, the same is inapplicable here where the respondent is a private practitioner.\nComplainant, however, failed to substantiate his charges against Atty. Tan.\nIn Hornilla v. Salunat, we explained that there is a conflict of interest when a lawyer represents inconsistent interests of two or more opposing parties. Since then, jurisprudence has developed three tests to determine the existence of conflict of interest: first, whether a lawyer is duty-bound to fight for an issue or claim on behalf of one client, and at the same time, to oppose that claim for the other client; second, whether acceptance of a new relation would prevent the discharge of the lawyer's duty of undivided fidelity and loyalty to the client, or invite suspicion of unfaithfulness or double-dealing in the performance of that duty; and third, whether the lawyer would be called upon in the new relation to use against a former client any confidential information acquired through their connection or previous employment.\nThis case falls under the third test.\nIn Parungao v. Atty. Lacuanan, the Court explained that the third test specifically applies to a situation wherein the professional engagement with the former client was already terminated when the lawyer entered into a new engagement with the present client. It bears to stress that the test explicitly requires the lawyer's use against the former client of \"confidential information acquired through their connection or previous employment.\"\nThe following circumstances must thus concur: first, the lawyer is called upon in his or her present engagement to make use against a former client confidential information which was acquired through their connection or previous employment; and second, the present engagement involves transactions that occurred during the lawyer's employment with the former client and matters that the lawyer previously handled for the said client.\nWe focus on the first circumstance, i.e., the lawyer used confidential information against the former client which was acquired when their relationship was still subsisting. Here, complainant insists that the Manila Case, which Atty. Tan used to file the deportation case against him, was a matter he previously handled as his counsel, hence, confidential information.\nWe are not persuaded.\nThe records are bereft of sufficient evidence to make this categorical finding. Though Atty. Tan did admit that he received PHP 200,000. as consideration for four cases he was endorsed to handle for complainant, or PHP 50,000. for each case, it was not clearly shown whether the Manila Case was one of these. To be sure, complainant did not submit any pleading or other document which may evince this Court to ordain otherwise. Notably, only the pleadings relating to the two Pasig Cases were signed by Atty. Tan, while the pleadings relating to the Manila Case were signed by complainant's counsel therein, Atty. Viaje. Neither did he allege, much less adduce evidence to show, that Atty. Tan was privy to the hold departure order mentioned in the letter-complaint against him.\nThe Court may not simply rely on mere allegations, conjectures, and suppositions in making its ruling. More important, it is well-settled that in disbarment cases, a lawyer enjoys the legal presumption of innocence until the contrary is proved. The burden of proof rests with the complainant who must establish the charges against the lawyer with the requisite quantum of proof, i.e., substantial evidence. In fine, complainant must adduce the amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.\nThis, complainant utterly failed to do.\nACCORDINGLY, the Court RESOLVES to DISMISS the case against Atty. Alex Y. Tan for utter lack of merit.\nSO ORDERED.\nLeonen, SAJ., (Chairperson), M. Lopez, J. Lopez, and Kho Jr., JJ., concur.\n","label":[[25,39,"CASE_NUM"],[50,70,"CASE_NUM"],[73,87,"PROM_DATE"],[90,102,"PERSON"],[127,138,"PERSON"],[149,167,"PERSON"],[198,211,"PERSON"],[238,250,"PERSON"],[291,302,"PERSON"],[310,313,"PERSON"],[325,343,"PERSON"],[351,358,"PERSON"],[389,396,"STA"],[418,453,"STA"],[455,458,"STA"],[652,655,"PERSON"],[664,700,"INS"],[926,943,"INS"],[945,948,"INS"],[951,983,"INS"],[985,988,"INS"],[991,1028,"INS"],[1030,1033,"INS"],[1186,1189,"PERSON"],[1253,1283,"CASE_NUM"],[1307,1329,"STA"],[1341,1361,"INS"],[1460,1483,"CASE_NUM"],[1507,1529,"STA"],[1541,1565,"INS"],[1624,1627,"PERSON"],[1715,1734,"CASE_NUM"],[1793,1813,"INS"],[2171,2174,"PERSON"],[2356,2359,"INS"],[2432,2435,"PERSON"],[2542,2564,"STA"],[2637,2644,"PERSON"],[2670,2673,"INS"],[2696,2714,"PERSON"],[2747,2754,"PERSON"],[2804,2840,"INS"],[3017,3020,"PERSON"],[3031,3038,"PERSON"],[3281,3284,"INS"],[3325,3328,"INS"],[3874,3877,"PERSON"],[3994,4006,"INS"],[4021,4024,"PERSON"],[4166,4183,"PERSON"],[4208,4224,"PERSON"],[4254,4290,"INS"],[4454,4457,"PERSON"],[4659,4662,"PERSON"],[4862,4865,"INS"],[5104,5107,"INS"],[5109,5112,"INS"],[5118,5121,"INS"],[5503,5512,"PERSON"],[5518,5521,"PERSON"],[5564,5588,"INS"],[5613,5627,"INS"],[5843,5846,"INS"],[5869,5872,"INS"],[6047,6050,"PERSON"],[6149,6152,"INS"],[6161,6187,"INS"],[6347,6350,"PERSON"],[6395,6398,"INS"],[7155,7158,"INS"],[7197,7200,"PERSON"],[7214,7247,"INS"],[7249,7252,"INS"],[7265,7272,"PERSON"],[7372,7375,"INS"],[7396,7451,"INS"],[7453,7456,"INS"],[7616,7619,"INS"],[7672,7675,"PERSON"],[7900,7903,"INS"],[7904,7907,"INS"],[7944,7947,"PERSON"],[8076,8079,"PERSON"],[8336,8339,"PERSON"],[8446,8454,"STA"],[8462,8465,"INS"],[8474,8482,"STA"],[9180,9183,"INS"],[9276,9296,"STA"],[9304,9307,"INS"],[9325,9333,"STA"],[9447,9454,"STA"],[10051,10054,"PERSON"],[10542,10546,"INS"],[10550,10563,"INS"],[10918,10921,"PERSON"],[10926,10934,"PERSON"],[10938,10945,"PERSON"],[11803,11811,"PERSON"],[11821,11829,"PERSON"],[12912,12915,"PERSON"],[13162,13165,"PERSON"],[13578,13581,"PERSON"],[13683,13688,"PERSON"],[13759,13762,"PERSON"],[14500,14511,"PERSON"],[14549,14555,"PERSON"],[14578,14586,"PERSON"],[14588,14596,"PERSON"],[14602,14609,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, RESPONDENT.\nD E C I S I O N\nDIMAAMPAO, J.:\nThe Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court challenges the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 155382, which declared that the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City properly acquired jurisdiction over the persons of Spouses Eloisa Clarito Abayon (Eloisa) and Rommil Regenia Abayon (petitioners), and which denied their motion for reconsideration, respectively.\nThe case originated from a complaint for sum of money filed by the Bank of the Philippine Islands (respondent) against petitioners before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Makati City, Branch 67. Respondent averred that it issued a credit card in favor of petitioners. Through the use of the said card, petitioners incurred an outstanding principal obligation of ₱285,260. as of October 6, 2014. Given that its several demands to pay such outstanding balance remained unheeded, respondent instituted the sum of money claim.\nAfter evaluating the allegations of the complaint, the Branch 21 of the MeTC acting for Branch 67, issued an Order dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. The MeTC declared that the amounts prayed for in the complaint exceeded the jurisdictional threshold of the first level court given that respondent failed to include the finance and late payment charges amounting to ₱121,850. in determining the principal amount.\nRespondent filed its notice of appeal and elevated the case to the RTC of Makati City, docketed as Civil Case No. 15-659 and raffled off to Branch 142 thereat. Subsequently, the trial court ordered respondent to file its memorandum within 15 days from receipt of its order, while directing petitioners to file their own within 15 days from their receipt of respondent's memorandum. Thereafter, the case would be submitted for decision.\nIn its Order dated April 15, 2016, the RTC affirmed the MeTC's dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction but held that it would take cognizance thereof pursuant to Section 8, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court as it had jurisdiction over the claimed amount. It also directed respondent to pay the required fees.\nAggrieved, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration Ad Cautelam. Therein, petitioners averred that the Order dated April 15, 2016 was premature and that they were deprived of their right to due process. They argued that they received respondent's memorandum on April 7, 2016, hence, they had until April 22, 2016 to file their memorandum but before they could do so, the assailed Order had already been rendered. Moreover, petitioners contended that the MeTC's lack of jurisdiction over the case could not vest the RTC with appellate jurisdiction. Petitioners also emphasized that they were seeking reconsideration without voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of the RTC.\nIn the Order dated September 9, 2016, the RTC denied petitioners' motion and reiterated that it had jurisdiction over the case. It noted that even if it were to take the arguments of petitioners into account, there would be no cogent reason to disturb its prior ruling.\nSubsequently in its Order dated September 20, 2016, the RTC dismissed the case without prejudice for respondent's failure to pay the required fees as provided in its Order dated April 15, 2016. 1aшphi1\nRespondent then filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated October 26, 2016 praying that the dismissal be reversed in the interest of substantial justice.\nResultantly, the RTC issued the Order dated March 9, 2017, reversing its earlier Order and directing respondent to comply with the payment of all required fees lest the case be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court.\nPetitioners filed their Motion for Reconsideration dated March 20, 2017, challenging the immediately foregoing Order for again violating their right to due process. Petitioners posited that the RTC erred in issuing the same despite initially setting respondent's Motion for Reconsideration dated October 26, 2016 for hearing on April 10, 2017. Petitioners argued that such a motion was litigious in nature and that they should have been afforded an opportunity to be heard and to oppose respondent's motion. Consequently, petitioners prayed that the March 9, 2017 Order be vacated for depriving them of their day in court.\nFinding merit in petitioners' motion and for respondent's failure to attend the scheduled hearing, the RTC vacated the March 9, 2017 Order and directed petitioners to file their comment or opposition to respondent's Motion for Reconsideration dated October 26, 2016 within three days therefrom, after which the matter would be submitted for the trial court's resolution.\nPetitioners filed their Opposition on April 17, 2017. Petitioners hammered on respondent's lackadaisical attitude in prosecuting its case as evidenced by its failure to make any attempts to pay the required fees. This amounted to inexcusable negligence which should result in the denial of respondent's motion for reconsideration. Petitioner also added that the present proceedings should be suspended as a matter of judicial courtesy owing to their pending petition for certiorari before the CA, docketed as CA-­G.R. No. 148337. The said petition questions the Orders dated April 15, 2016 and September 9, 2016 rendered by the Regional Trial Court, docketed as C.A.-G.R. SP. No. 148337.\nIn its Order dated May 9, 2017, the RTC still resolved to grant respondent's motion for reconsideration dated October 26, 2016 in the interest of substantial justice. The trial court highlighted that procedural technicalities should never defeat substantive rights. The RTC then issued summons to petitioners.\nPetitioners moved for reconsideration on June 6, 2017. Before the RTC could act on this motion, summons was served to petitioners on June 23, 2017.\nPetitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss ( via Special Appearance) on July 7, 2017. They contended that the service of summons was premature, as their motion for reconsideration on the May 9, 2017 Order was still pending. Additionally, petitioners averred that the service of summons was also defective as it was not served personally to petitioners as required by the Rules of Court.\nIn the Order dated August 4, 2017, the RTC denied the motion to dismiss and directed petitioners to file their answer to respondent's complaint. The RTC noted that the Officer's Return dated June 27, 2017 reflects that the summons was received by a certain Apollo Mangaya (Mangaya), who was the mailing receiver of Globe Tower, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, per the instruction of petitioner Eloisa herself to the building receptionist. In light of the foregoing, petitioners could not now claim that they were improperly served with the summons.\nUndeterred, petitioners again moved for reconsideration and stressed that their motion for reconsideration filed on June 6, 2017 remained unresolved. Notwithstanding the purported contents of the Officer's Return, petitioners maintained that serious attempts to personally serve the summons was necessary before substituted service may be availed of.\nStill, petitioners were rebuffed by the RTC in its Order dated February 1, 2018.\nPetitioners then filed a petition for certiorari before the CA, arguing that the Orders dated August 4, 2017 and February 1, 2018 were attended with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\nIn the impugned Decision, the CA dismissed the petition for lack of merit. As to petitioners' assignment of error with regard to their unacted upon motion for reconsideration filed on June 6, 2017, the appellate court held that an unacted upon motion within due time was deemed denied. The motion was also impliedly denied by the RTC when it rendered its August 4, 2017 Order that upheld the service of summons to petitioners. Moreover, the CA observed that the special civil action for certiorari generally may not lie against a denial of a motion to dismiss because the movant would still have an adequate remedy before the trial court  that is, to file an answer and subsequently appeal the case. As to the purported improper service of summons, the CA agreed that the process server's efforts to personally serve the same upon petitioners was indeed lacking. However, the CA noted that petitioners never denied that it was upon their instruction that the service of summons was received by Mangaya. Finally, the CA declared that the peculiar circumstances of the case belie petitioners' argument that the trial court failed to acquire jurisdiction over them. It stressed that petitioners, on more than one occasion, sought affirmative relief from the RTC, which amounted to a voluntary submission to the trial court's jurisdiction.\nPetitioners sought reconsideration, but were denied in the oppugned Resolution. Hence, they instituted the present Petition, ascribing error to the CA in upholding the challenged orders of the RTC. As an aside, the petition likewise seeks the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and\/or temporary restraining order to enjoin the RTC from continuing the proceedings in Civil Case No. 15-659 pending resolution of this matter.\nIssues\nThe primary issues tendered for this Court's resolution are whether the CA erred in: (1) upholding the Orders dated August 4, 2017 and February 1, 2018 of the RTC; and (2) concluding that the RTC acquired jurisdiction over petitioners.\nThe Ruling of the Court\nThe Petition is partly meritorious. 1aшphi1\nAt the outset, the Court clarifies that its review of the impugned Decision and Resolution of the CA is limited to determining and correcting any error of judgment committed in the exercise of its jurisdiction; specifically, the Court will evaluate the case in the prism of whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC.\nConsidered in this light, the CA appears to have committed reversible error in arriving at its conclusion.\nThe Orders dated August 4, 2017 and February 1, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court violated petitioners' right to due process.\nTo recall, petitioners asserted in their petition for certiorari that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it served summons, and then subsequently issued its Order dated August 4, 2017, which denied petitioners' motion to dismiss, even before it acted upon petitioners' motion for reconsideration on the Order dated May 9, 2017. Petitioners decried these violations to their right to due process, especially since they were precisely asking the RTC to reconsider its resumption of jurisdiction over respondent's complaint, notwithstanding the latter's failure to heed the trial court's earlier directive to pay the necessary filing fees.\nIn addressing the same, the CA held that the unresolved motion for reconsideration was \"impliedly denied\" by the RTC through its August 4, 2017 Order, reasoning that in issuing the foregoing, the trial court had occasion to \"go over the record of the case and review the series of events that led to the issuance and service of the summons upon [petitioners].\" The appellate court cited the case of Orosa v. Court of Appeals, ( Orosa ) where the Court held that \"a motion that is not acted upon in due time is deemed denied.\"\nThe CA's reliance on Orosa was misplaced.\nA perusal of the Court's disquisition in Orosa would readily reveal that it was not on all fours with the factual circumstances of the present case, as what was under consideration there was a mere motion for additional time to file answer. Even in subsequent reiterations of this doctrine, the Court has never held that a trial court may ignore, much less dispense with, the resolution of a motion for reconsideration to its orders.\nIn Sps. Salise v. Salcedo, the doctrine was also applied with respect to a motion for extension of time to file compliance.\nInterestingly, in Eversley Childs Sanitarium v. Sps. Barbarona, the Court reiterated this doctrine but with respect to a motion to withdraw filed by the Solicitor General of its motion for reconsideration of the CA's adverse decision. Without acting on the motion to withdraw, the CA ruled on the motion for reconsideration, which the Court held was an effective denial of the motion to withdraw. Despite this finding, the Court nevertheless treated the CA's Resolution on the motion for reconsideration as without legal effect, given that it was issued in violation of the CA's own Internal Rules which provide that a subsequent motion for reconsideration would be deemed abandoned if the movant filed a petition for review or motion for extension of time to file a petition for review before this Court. In arriving at this conclusion, the Court's foremost concern was to ensure that petitioner would not be deprived of its day in court because of mere technicalities, more so when the fault rested with the CA in not applying its own rules in treating the motion for reconsideration as abandoned.\nIndeed, an earnest reading of the foregoing cases would show that the CA erred in applying the doctrine in Orosa. A motion for reconsideration is not in the nature of a motion for additional time to file a pleading.\nA motion for extension of time to file a pleading pa1iakes the nature of an accommodation grounded on a sufficient reason and is always left to the sound discretion of the court.\nOn the other hand, a motion for reconsideration is filed \"to convince the court that its ruling is erroneous and improper, contrary to the law or the evidence,\" thus affording the court ample opportunity to rectify the same. By arbitrarily ignoring such a motion and continuing the proceedings, the trial court would be impairing the movant-party's right to be heard, which is a basic tenet of the fundamental right to due process. This finds special significance in this case since the Order that petitioners sought to reconsider was precisely on the RTC's resumption of jurisdiction over the case which it had already previously dismissed.\nUndoubtedly, the spirit of liberality behind the Court's pronouncement in Eversley Childs Sanitarium should find application to the case at hand in order to prevent petitioner from losing its day in court due to the RTC's own actions of disregarding its standing motion for reconsideration.\nIndeed, no less than the Constitution itself provides that \" [a]ll cases or matters filed after the effectivity of this Constitution must be decided or resolved within twenty-four months from date of submission for the Supreme Court, and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court, twelve months for all lower collegiate courts, and three months for all other lower courts.\"\nThis mandate directs judges to judicially dispose of the court's business, by resolving motions and incidents pending before them without delay, and by deciding cases within the required period. This directive is also embodied in Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 1-88 which states that \"[a]ll Presiding Judges must endeavor to act to promptly on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before their courts.\"\nWell-settled is the rule that grave abuse of discretion arises when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence, as in this case. By failing to timely act on the motion for reconsideration, the subsequent assailed Orders of the RTC were rendered in violation of petitioners' right to due process, contrary to the position of the CA. Consequently, these must be annulled and set aside.\nNevertheless, the Court clarifies that the nullification of the Orders dated August 4, 2017 and February 1, 2018 of the RTC would not result in the dismissal of the case. These two orders dealt only with the resolution of petitioners' Motion to Dismiss dated July 5, 2017. Even disregarding the same, the status quo would be determined by the trial court's Order dated May 9, 2017, which affirmed its jurisdiction over the subject matter of respondent's complaint.\nSurely, by the trial court's own subsequent actions, it would not be difficult to guess how it would rule on petitioners' motion for reconsideration, and any further inquiry into the propriety of its determination would not only be beyond the scope of the Court's review but would be an exercise in futility. In the end, it is preferred that litigation be decided on the merits and not on technicality to afford both party-litigants the ample opportunity to ventilate their rights.\nThe Regional Trial Court has acquired jurisdiction over the petitioners.\nAs to the second issue on whether the CA correctly upheld the RTC's determination that it had acquired jurisdiction over petitioners through the purportedly improper service of summons, the Court rules in the affirmative.\nAs correctly observed by the CA, the process server's attempts to personally serve the summons to petitioners was wanting. As the preferred mode of service, the return must indicate the steps taken by the sheriff to comply with the same, before substituted service may be availed of. Failure to properly serve summons would mean that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.\nHowever, the peculiar circumstances in this case warrant a relaxation of this rule. As the CA shrewdly noted, petitioners never denied that the summons was received by Mangaya per instruction of petitioner Eloisa Clarito Abayon herself to the building receptionist. Certainly, there is nothing in the Motion to Dismiss dated July 5, 2017, nor in its petition before the Court, that would show that petitioners denied ever giving such an instruction. While this fact would not operate to do away with the express requirement under the Rules of Court on personal service, it should operate to estop petitioners from raising such an argument to divest the RTC of jurisdiction over their persons given that estoppel operates to render an admission conclusive upon the person making the same.\nIn any event, even assuming that the summons were invalid, the RTC would have still acquired jurisdiction over petitioners by their voluntary submission.\n\"Generally, defendants voluntarily submit to the court's jurisdiction when they participate in the proceedings despite improper service of summons.\" Indeed, by filing pleadings where there are no unequivocal objections to the jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, the defendant may be said to have voluntarily submitted to the court's jurisdiction, which is equivalent to a valid service of summons.\nNotably, while petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration to the Order dated April 15, 2016 was filed ad cautelam, its Motion for Reconsideration to the Order dated March 9, 2017, which sought to vacate the foregoing Order and to set respondent's motion for hearing, was filed without reservations and was, in fact, granted by the trial court. Its Opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration dated October 26, 2016, and its Motion for Reconsideration to the Order dated May 9, 2017, lacked similar reservations. It was only in its Motion to Dismiss dated July 5, 2017 that petitioners again made a reservation that the pleading was filed via special appearance.\nEvidently, even if the Court were to void the summons served, petitioners have already actively participated and sought affirmative relief from the RTC. Their numerous pleadings have shown that notice has been effected and that they have been adequately notified of the proceedings to allow them to sufficiently defend their interests.\nConsequently, the RTC properly acquired jurisdiction over petitioners.\nWith that, there is no further need to pass upon the other arguments raised. In the same vein, petitioner's concurrent application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and\/or temporary restraining order is necessarily denied.\nTHE FOREGOING DISQUISITIONS CONSIDERED, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby PARTLY GRANTED . The Decision dated April 29, 2019 and the Resolution dated September 13, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 155382 are SET ASIDE in accordance with this Decision. The application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and\/or temporary restraining order is DENIED .\nSO ORDERED.\nCaguioa, (Chairperson), Inting, Gaerlan, and Singh, JJ., concur.\n","label":[[24,39,"CASE_NUM"],[41,55,"PROM_DATE"],[66,87,"PERSON"],[92,113,"PERSON"],[132,162,"INS"],[192,201,"PERSON"],[251,258,"STA"],[266,280,"STA"],[327,343,"INS"],[345,347,"INS"],[352,373,"CASE_NUM"],[399,419,"INS"],[421,424,"INS"],[500,521,"PERSON"],[523,529,"PERSON"],[535,556,"PERSON"],[704,734,"INS"],[779,803,"INS"],[805,809,"INS"],[1238,1242,"INS"],[1336,1340,"INS"],[1662,1665,"INS"],[1694,1715,"CASE_NUM"],[2070,2073,"INS"],[2087,2091,"INS"],[2216,2223,"STA"],[2231,2245,"STA"],[2808,2812,"INS"],[2869,2872,"INS"],[3027,3030,"INS"],[3074,3077,"INS"],[3358,3361,"INS"],[3674,3677,"INS"],[3882,3889,"STA"],[3897,3911,"STA"],[4107,4110,"INS"],[4639,4642,"INS"],[5400,5402,"INS"],[5416,5435,"CASE_NUM"],[5535,5555,"INS"],[5569,5593,"CASE_NUM"],[5631,5634,"INS"],[5865,5868,"INS"],[5971,5974,"INS"],[6419,6433,"STA"],[6474,6477,"INS"],[6584,6587,"INS"],[6692,6706,"PERSON"],[6708,6715,"PERSON"],[6828,6834,"PERSON"],[7374,7377,"INS"],[7475,7477,"INS"],[7665,7667,"INS"],[7965,7968,"INS"],[8076,8078,"INS"],[8389,8391,"INS"],[8512,8514,"INS"],[8652,8654,"INS"],[8891,8894,"INS"],[9120,9122,"INS"],[9165,9168,"INS"],[9309,9312,"INS"],[9348,9369,"CASE_NUM"],[9484,9486,"INS"],[9571,9574,"INS"],[9604,9607,"INS"],[9814,9816,"INS"],[10002,10004,"INS"],[10098,10101,"INS"],[10133,10135,"INS"],[10409,10412,"INS"],[10793,10796,"INS"],[11014,11016,"INS"],[11099,11102,"INS"],[11385,11390,"PERSON"],[11394,11410,"INS"],[11414,11419,"PERSON"],[11516,11518,"INS"],[11533,11538,"PERSON"],[11595,11600,"PERSON"],[11996,12002,"PERSON"],[12006,12013,"PERSON"],[12130,12156,"INS"],[12165,12174,"PERSON"],[12324,12326,"INS"],[12393,12395,"INS"],[12566,12568,"INS"],[12686,12688,"INS"],[12695,12709,"STA"],[13122,13124,"INS"],[13282,13284,"INS"],[13319,13324,"PERSON"],[14159,14162,"INS"],[14323,14349,"INS"],[14465,14468,"INS"],[14759,14772,"INS"],[14801,14814,"INS"],[15139,15185,"STA"],[15612,15615,"INS"],[15713,15715,"INS"],[15889,15892,"INS"],[16720,16740,"INS"],[16827,16829,"INS"],[16851,16854,"INS"],[17040,17042,"INS"],[17509,17511,"INS"],[17624,17645,"PERSON"],[17952,17966,"STA"],[18071,18074,"INS"],[18269,18272,"INS"],[19577,19580,"INS"],[19783,19786,"INS"],[20268,20284,"INS"],[20288,20309,"CASE_NUM"],[20486,20493,"PERSON"],[20510,20516,"PERSON"],[20518,20525,"PERSON"],[20531,20536,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

CRUZ, SERGIO OSMEÑA III, TIRSO ANTIPORDA JR., VICTOR S. ZIGA, LUIS M. MIRASOL, JR., AND JOSE Y. FERIA, PETITIONERS, VS. EDUARDO M. COJUANGCO JR., ENRIQUEZ M. COJUANGCO, MANUEL M. COJUANGCO, ESTELITO P. MENDOZA, AND GABRIEL L. VILLAREAL, RESPONDENTS.\nD E C I S I O N\nZALAMEDA, J.:\nThis is a Petition for Review on Certiorari (Petition) assailing the Decision dated 15 July 2014 (Assailed Decision) and the Resolution dated 25 November 2014 (Assailed Resolution) of the Sandiganbayan in Civil Case SB Nos. 0166 and 0169, which partially granted the petitions for quo warranto filed by respondents Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr., Enriquez M. Cojuangco, Manuel M. Cojuangco, Estelito P. Mendoza (Mendoza), and Gabriel L. Villareal.\nAntecedents\nDuring the 1995 annual stockholders' meeting of San Miguel Corporation (SMC), respondents and individual petitioners Julieta C. Bertuben (Bertuben), Ide C. Tillah (Tillah), Emmanuel E. Cruz (Cruz), Sergio Osmeña III, and Tirso D. Antiporda Jr. (Antiporda), were among the nominees who vied for a seat in the SMC Board of Directors (SMC Board).\nIndividual petitioners were nominated by petitioner Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) following the registration in their respective names of SMC sequestered shares of stock belonging to some 43 corporate stockholders (Corporate Shares), in order to allow the nominees to qualify for the SMC Board. PCGG voted the Corporate Shares in favor of the individual petitioners. On the other hand, Mendoza, as the appointed proxy of said corporate shareholders, voted the Corporate Shares in favor of respondents.\nFollowing the canvass of the votes cast, the individual petitioners were declared to have been the elected as members of the SMC Board. None of the respondents made it.\nMendoza protested the results of the election questioning PCGG's authority to vote the Corporate Shares. He also argued that the registration of the Corporate Shares in the name of individual petitioners was improper, thus, the latter should have been disqualified for not owning at least 5,000 shares in SMC as required under the corporation's By-laws. Petitioner Jose Feria (Feria), then SMC's corporate secretary, overruled the protest. This prompted the filing of the quo warranto petition docketed as Civil Case SB. No. 0166.\nA similar factual scenario happened during the 1996 annual shareholders' meeting where individual petitioners Bertuben, Tillah, Cruz, Antiporda, Victor S. Ziga, and Luis M. Mirasol, Jr., as PCGG nominees, were declared elected to the SMC Board. Respondents thereafter filed another quo warranto petition docketed as Civil Case SB. No. 0169.\nIn its Resolutions dated 09 May 1995 and 07 May 1996, the Sandiganbayan dismissed the quo warranto petitions for lack of jurisdiction. Respondents questioned the said dismissal before this Court in Cojuangco, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan, where We held that Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over petitions for quo warranto \"when it involves incident arising from, or related to PCGG cases over alleged 'ill-gotten wealth' within the context of Section 2 of Executive Order No. 14.\" Accordingly, the Court directed the Sandiganbayan to give due course to respondents' petitions for quo warranto.\nIn compliance thereto, the Sandiganbayan directed petitioners to file their responsive pleadings. The order notwithstanding, petitioners filed Motion to Dismiss dated 17 March 1997 in Civil Case SB No. 0166 on the ground of mootness due to the expiration of the term of the individual petitioners. In Civil Case SB No. 0169, petitioners filed a Motion to Hold in Abeyance dated 10 April 1997 citing the pendency of G.R. No. 115352 before this Court, which allegedly involves issues similar to the present case.\nRespondents opposed the said motions arguing, among others, that the issues remained relevant despite the lapse of the individual petitioners' term of office and that G.R. No. 115352 cannot be the basis for suspending the proceedings since said case involved the election of the 1993 SMC Board. Respondents then prayed that the petitioners be declared in default for their failure to file responsive pleadings.\nMeanwhile, Feria filed a motion to suspend the running of the period to file his responsive pleading pending the resolution of the motion to hold the case in abeyance. Feria subsequently filed an Answer dated 23 December 1997 after the promulgation of the Court's resolution in G.R. No. 115352 remanding to the Sandiganbayan the petition subject thereof.\nOn 15 July 2014, the Sandiganbayan rendered the Assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court resolves as follows:\n1. to DENY petitioners' counter-motion to declare respondents in default in both cases;\n2. to ADMIT respondent Feria's Answer attached to his motion to admit the same;\n3. to PARTLY GRANT the instant Petitions. The election of respondents Julieta C. Bertuben, Ide C. Tillah, Emmanuel E. Cruz, Sergio Osmeña III, Tirso D. Antiporda, Jr. as members of the Board of Directors of SMC in 1995, and respondents Julieta C. Bertuben, Ide C. Tillah, Emmanuel E. Cruz, Jr., Tirso D. Antiporda, Jr., Victor S. Ziga and Luis M. Mirasol, Jr. as members of the Board of Directors of SMC in 1996, are declared void and are hereby set aside.\nSO ORDERED.\nThe Sandiganbayan, adopting a policy of liberality, treated the motions filed by petitioners as substantial compliance to its orders, albeit not being responsive pleadings. It then rejected petitioners' mootness argument citing two of the established exceptions to the mootness doctrine, i.e., (i) the issue raised requires the formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, bar and public, and (ii) the case is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\nAnent the main issue of whether PCGG has authority to vote the Corporate Shares, the Sandiganbayan ruled in the negative. It declared that the registered owners of the Corporate Shares, not the PCGG, had the authority to vote the same citing the pronouncements of the Court in Bataan Shipyard & Engineering Company, Inc. v. PCGG (BASECO) and Republic v. Sandiganbayan (Republic). Consequently, the Sandiganbayan declared the nullity of the election of the individual petitioners, but held that respondents cannot be declared duly elected members of the SMC Board consistent with Cojuangco Jr. v. Roxas (Cojuangco Jr.) and since there was \"no showing that [respondent] Mendoza cast his vote and those of the principals he was representing by way of proxy during the election.\"\nPetitioners moved for reconsideration reiterating that the case has been mooted by the expiration of the term of office of the individual petitioners and the promulgation of the decision of the Court in Republic. The motion was denied by the Sandiganbayan in the Assailed Resolution.\nHence, the instant Petition.\nIssues\nPetitioners maintain that the quo warranto petitions should be dismissed for mootness in view of subsequent elections of the SMC Board from 1997 to the present and the Court s decision in Republic. In the alternative, petitioners contend that if dismissal is not warranted, they should be given the opportunity to present evidence as they were deprived of their right to due process when Sandiganbayan ruled on the merits of the quo warranto petitions in resolving respondents' motion to declare petitioners in default.\nRespondents, on the other hand, argue that petitioners' theory that a quo warranto petition automatically becomes moot upon the expiration of term would set a dangerous precedent. They claim that Sandiganbayan correctly ruled that the exceptions to the mootness principle apply in this case. Anent the argument of denial of due process, respondents contend that petitioners were given the opportunity to submit responsive pleadings, which they failed to do.\nRuling of the Court\nThe Petition is meritorious. The Sandiganbayan should have dismissed the quo warranto petitions for being moot and academic.\nA moot and academic case is one that ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical value. As a rule, courts decline jurisdiction over such case, or dismiss it on ground of mootness.\nIn Legaspi Towers 300, Inc., v. Muer, a case for nullification of election of the board of directors of Legaspi Towers 300, Inc., the Court affirmed the .resolution of the appellate court that the subsequent election of a new set of board of directors rendered the case moot and academic.\nHere, the expiration of the term of office of the individual petitioners as members of the SMC Board for the years 1995 and 1996 is a supervening event that renders the quo warranto petitions moot and academic. 1aшphi1\nIn a quo warranto case, where usurpation is found, judgment shall be rendered ousting respondents from the office and determining the respective rights in arid to the said office. As correctly argued by petitioners, the grant of the prayer in the quo warranto petitions, i.e., the ouster of the individual petitioners from the SMC Board, would serve no useful purpose as there is no one to oust.\nTo be clear, this is not to say that the expiration of the term of office automatically results in the dismissal of a quo warranto case. It is well to note that We have previously resolved the quo warranto petitions involving the election of PCGG nominees in the 1989 election of the SMC Board in Cojuangco Jr., notwithstanding the expiration of the term of office of the PCGG nominees therein. The Court stated:\nIt is true that in G.R. No. 91925 the term of office of the assailed members of the board of directors, private respondents therein, for 1989-1990 had expired. To this extent said petition may be considered moot and academic. However, the issue of whether public respondent Sandiganbayan committed a grave abuse of discretion in rendering the resolution dated November 16, 1989, which affects all subsequent shareholders' meetings and elections of the members of the board of directors of SMC, is a justiciable controversy that must be resolved.\nAs to G.R. No. 93005 the term of office of private respondents as members of the SMC board of directors will expire on or after another election is held in April 1991.\nThus, the issue raised in G.R. No. 93005 relating to the election of the members of the board for 1990-1991 pursuant to sequestered shares of stock is a justiciable issue which should be determined once and for all.\nClearly, the Court in Cojuangco Jr. [1991] saw it fit to resolve the quo warranto petitions upon a finding that the case remained justiciable. Indeed, pending the main sequestration suit, the resolution of the right of PCGG to vote the sequestered shares would affect subsequent shareholders' meetings and elections, as it in fact affects the 1991 SMC Board elections subject of G.R. No. 93005.\nRelatedly, in Antiporda, J, v. Sandiganbayan ( Antiporda ), the Court ordered the remand of the case in 2001 notwithstanding the fact that the quo warranto case therein pertains to the 1994 SMC Board elections. The Court likewise remanded the case pertaining to the 1998 SMC Board elections in PCGG v. Cojuangco Jr. ( PCGG [1999] ). Like Cojuangco Jr. , these cases were decided by the Court during the pendency of the main sequestration suit.\nThe right to vote shares is a mere incident of ownership thereof. The registered owner of the share, as a general rule, exercises such right. However, in sequestration proceedings initiated by the PCGG, the right to vote becomes a separate issue in view of the jurisprudence setting forth exceptions to the aforesaid general rule as will be discussed further below. Nevertheless, the final resolution on the issue of ownership of sequestered shares would necessarily render the incidental issue on the right to vote moot and academic. 1aшphi1\nThus, in resolving the issue on who between the PCGG and the corporate stockholders has the right to vote the SMC-sequestered shares during the 1998 SMC Board elections, the Court in PCGG stated:\nThe fact that the sequestration remains does not automatically deprive the stockholders of their right to vote those shares which is a basic feature of their ownership  although questioned. But in resolving who should vote the sequestered shares, necessitates a determination of the alleged ill-­gotten character of those shares and consequently the rightful ownership thereof, which issue is still the subject of the main case still pending in the courts. In any case, what is involved herein is merely an incident of the main case and is limited only to the stockholders meeting scheduled for April 20, 1998. This resolution is without prejudice to the final disposition of the merits of the main suit.\nUntil the main sequestration suit is resolved, the right to vote the SMC sequestered shares depends on whether the two-tiered test set by the Court in its June 10, 1993 Resolution in G.R. No. 115352 (Cojuangco v. Calpo) concurs.\nUnlike Cojuangco Jr. [1991], Antiporda, and PCGG [1999], the instant case no longer presents any justiciable controversy in light of the decision of the Court in Republic, which declared the Cojuangco et al. block of SMC shares, or the Corporate Shares herein, as exclusive property of the registered owners thereof. The fallo reads:\nWHEREFORE, the Court dismisses the petitions for certiorari in G.R. Nos. 166859 and 169023; denies the petition for review on certiorari in G.R. No. 180702; and, accordingly, affirms the decision promulgated by the Sandiganbayan on November 28, 2007 in Civil Case No. 0033-F.\nThe Court declares that the block of shares in San Miguel Corporation in the names of respondents Cojuangco, et al. subject of Civil Case No. 0033-F is the exclusive property of Cojuangco, et al. as registered owners.\nAccordingly, the lifting and setting aside of the Writs of Sequestration affecting said block of shares (namely: Writ of Sequestration No. 86-0062 dated April 21, 1986; Writ of Sequestration No. 86-0069 dated April 22, 1986; Writ of Sequestration No. 86-0085 dated May 9, 1986; Writ of Sequestration No. 86-0095 dated May 16, 1986; Writ of Sequestration No. 86-0096 dated May 16, 1986; Writ of Sequestration No. 86-0097 dated May 16, 1986; Writ of Sequestration No. 86-0098 dated May 16, 1986; Writ of Sequestration No. 86-0042 dated April 8, 1986; and Writ of Sequestration No. 87-0218 dated May 27, 1987) are affirmed; and the annotation of the conditions prescribed in the Resolutions promulgated on October 8, 2003 and June 24, 2005 is cancelled.\nSO ORDERED. (Emphasis in the original. Italics and underscoring supplied)\nRepublic involved three consolidated petitions relating to the Cojuangco et al. block of SMC shares, which shares were subject of the Third Amended Complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 0033-F. There, We affirmed the ruling of the Sandiganbayan dismissing the Third Amended Compliant for failure of the Republic to establish by preponderance of evidence that the said SMC shares were illegally acquired using coconut­levy funds. The lifting of the writs of sequestration affecting sa1d block of shares was likewise upheld.\nAs admitted by both parties, Republic resolved the issue of ownership of the Corporate Shares. The issue in Civil Case SB Nos. 0166 and 0169 was limited to the right to vote the said shares. Since the right to vote is an incident of ownership, any decision of the Sandiganbayan on the said issue would be subject to the final disposition on the ownership of the Corporate Shares. As such, the disposition of the issue of ownership of the Corporate Shares, as well as the lifting of the writs of sequestration thereon, laid to rest any and all issue on the authority of the PCGG to vote the same.\nFurther, the Court does not agree with the Sandiganbayan that the exceptions to the mootness principle apply in this case.\nAt this juncture, it bears emphasizing that the Assailed Decision, in so far as it resolved the authority of the PCGG to vote the Corporate Shares, did not formulate any new principles for the guidance of the bench and the bar. The issues raised do not call for a clarification of any constitutional or legal principle. This is because the scope and extent of PCGG's authority over sequestered shares has long been settled.\nIn BASECO, the Court laid down the guiding principles in relation to the authority of PCGG over sequestered properties. There, the Court stated that PCGG as a conservator \"cannot exercise acts of dominion over property sequestered, frozen or provisionally taken over,\" and may exercise only powers of administration over the same. However, it was clarified that \"in the special instance of a business enterprise shown by evidence to have been 'taken over by the government of the Marcos Administration or by entities or persons close to former President Marcos,' x x x the PCGG may in this case exercise some measure of control in the operation, running, or management of the business itself. But even in this special situation, the intrusion into management should be restricted to the minimum degree necessary to accomplish the legislative will, which is 'to prevent the disposal or dissipation' of the business enterprise.\" The Court likewise held that \"it is within the parameters of these conditions and circumstances that the PCGG may properly exercise the prerogative to vote sequestered stock of corporations\".\nCojuangco Jr. then reiterated the principles laid in BASECO, and established minimum. safeguards to enable the PCGG to perform its functions as conservator of the sequestered shares of stock pending final determination by the courts as to whether or not the same constitutes ill-gotten wealth or a final compromise agreement between the parties. The Court likewise made a pronouncement on the effect of the nullity of the election of the PCGG nominees to the SMC Board, viz :\nIn the light of the foregoing discussion, the Court finds and so holds that the PCGG has no right to vote the sequestered shares of petitioners including the sequestered corporate shares. Only their owners, duly authorized representatives or proxies may vote the said shares. Consequently, the election of private respondents Adolfo Azcuna, Edison Coseteng and Patricio Pineda as members of the board of directors of SMC for 1990-1991 should be set aside.\nHowever, petitioners cannot be declared duly elected members of the board of directors thereby. An election for the purpose should be held where the questioned shares may be voted by their owners and\/or their proxies. Such election may be held at the next shareholders' meeting in April 1991 or at such date as may be set under the by-laws of SMC.\nPrivate respondents in both cases are hereby declared to be de facto officers who in good faith assumed their duties and responsibilities as duly elected members of the board of directors of the SMC. They are thereby legally entitled to the emoluments of the office including salary, fees and other compensation attached to the office until they vacate the same.\nThe rules regarding the authority of the PCGG to vote sequestered shares were further elucidated in subsequent cases which were summarized in Republic v. COCOFED, to wit:\nGeneral Rule: Sequestered Shares Are Voted by the Registered Holder\nAt the outset, it is necessary to restate the general rule that the registered owner of the shares of a corporation exercises the right and the privilege of voting. This principle applies even to shares that are sequestered by the government, over which the PCGG as a mere conservator cannot, as a general rule, exercise acts of dominion. On the other hand, it is authorized to vote these sequestered shares registered in the names of private persons and acquired with allegedly ill-gotten wealth, if it is able to satisfy the two-tiered test devised by the Court in Cojuangco v. Calpo and PCGG v. Cojuangco Jr., as follows:\n(1) Is there prima facie evidence showing that the said shares are ill-gotten and thus belong to the State?\n(2) Is there an imminent danger of dissipation, thus necessitating their continued sequestration and voting by the PCGG, while the main issue is pending with the Sandiganbayan?\nSequestered Shares Acquired with Public Funds Are an Exception\nFrom the foregoing general principle, the Court in Baseco v. PCGG (hereinafter \"Baseco\") and Cojuangco Jr. v. Roxas (\"Cojuangco-­Roxas\") has provided two clear \"public character\" exceptions under which the government is granted the authority to vote the shares:\n(1) Where government shares are taken over by private persons or entities who\/which registered them in their own names, and\n(2) Where the capitalization or shares that were acquired with public funds somehow landed in private hands.\nx x x x\nIn short, when sequestered shares registered in the names of private individuals or entities are alleged to have been acquired with ill-gotten wealth, then the two-tiered test is applied. However, when the sequestered shares in the name of private individuals or entities are shown, prima facie, to have been (1) originally government shares, or (2) purchased with public funds or those affected with public interest, then the two-tiered test does not apply. Rather, the public character exceptions in Baseco v. PCGG and Cojuangco Jr. v. Roxas prevail; that is, the government shall vote the shares.\nNotably, the foregoing principles were applied by the Sandiganbayan in the Assailed Decision.\nFinally, the Court is not convinced that the case is capable of repetition, yet evading review. For the said exception to apply, two elements must concur: (1) the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again. Here, the second element is absent in view of Republic, which already laid to rest the controversy on ownership of the Corporate Shares and the incidental issue regarding PCGG's authority to vote the same.\nWith the foregoing disquisition, the Court finds it unnecessary to discuss the alleged denial of due process.\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is GRANTED . The Decision dated 15 July 2014 and the Resolution dated 25 November 2014 by the Sandiganbayan in Civil Case SB Nos. 0166 and 0169 are REVERSED AND SET ASIDE . The petitions for quo warranto in Civil Case SB Nos. 0166 and 0169 are hereby dismissed for being moot and academic.\nSO ORDERED.\nHernando, (Acting Chairperson), Gaerlan, and Rosario, JJ., concur.\nMarquez, J., on official business.\n","label":[[24,43,"CASE_NUM"],[45,59,"PROM_DATE"],[62,104,"INS"],[106,125,"PERSON"],[127,140,"PERSON"],[142,158,"PERSON"],[160,177,"PERSON"],[179,198,"PERSON"],[200,214,"PERSON"],[216,236,"PERSON"],[242,255,"PERSON"],[274,298,"PERSON"],[300,321,"PERSON"],[323,342,"PERSON"],[344,363,"PERSON"],[369,389,"PERSON"],[622,635,"INS"],[639,671,"CASE_NUM"],[749,773,"PERSON"],[775,796,"PERSON"],[798,817,"PERSON"],[819,838,"PERSON"],[840,847,"PERSON"],[854,874,"PERSON"],[936,958,"INS"],[960,963,"INS"],[1005,1024,"PERSON"],[1026,1034,"PERSON"],[1037,1050,"PERSON"],[1052,1058,"PERSON"],[1061,1077,"PERSON"],[1079,1083,"PERSON"],[1086,1103,"PERSON"],[1109,1131,"PERSON"],[1133,1142,"PERSON"],[1196,1199,"INS"],[1200,1218,"INS"],[1220,1229,"INS"],[1297,1326,"INS"],[1328,1332,"INS"],[1390,1393,"INS"],[1536,1545,"INS"],[1547,1551,"INS"],[1879,1888,"INS"],[1923,1930,"PERSON"],[1981,1985,"INS"],[2228,2231,"INS"],[2288,2298,"PERSON"],[2300,2305,"PERSON"],[2313,2316,"INS"],[2429,2452,"CASE_NUM"],[2564,2572,"PERSON"],[2574,2580,"PERSON"],[2582,2586,"PERSON"],[2588,2597,"PERSON"],[2599,2613,"PERSON"],[2619,2639,"PERSON"],[2644,2648,"INS"],[2688,2697,"INS"],[2770,2793,"CASE_NUM"],[2993,3007,"PERSON"],[3011,3024,"INS"],[3045,3058,"INS"],[3163,3167,"INS"],[3242,3264,"STA"],[3303,3316,"INS"],[3407,3420,"INS"],[3564,3586,"CASE_NUM"],[3681,3703,"CASE_NUM"],[3795,3810,"CASE_NUM"],[4058,4073,"CASE_NUM"],[4175,4184,"INS"],[4470,4475,"PERSON"],[4580,4595,"CASE_NUM"],[4613,4626,"INS"],[4678,4691,"INS"],[4948,4952,"PERSON"],[5075,5094,"PERSON"],[5096,5109,"PERSON"],[5111,5127,"PERSON"],[5129,5146,"PERSON"],[5148,5171,"PERSON"],[5190,5208,"INS"],[5212,5215,"INS"],[5241,5260,"PERSON"],[5262,5275,"PERSON"],[5277,5298,"PERSON"],[5300,5323,"PERSON"],[5325,5339,"PERSON"],[5344,5364,"PERSON"],[5383,5401,"INS"],[5405,5408,"INS"],[5478,5491,"INS"],[5972,5976,"INS"],[6025,6038,"INS"],[6134,6138,"INS"],[6217,6260,"INS"],[6264,6268,"INS"],[6270,6276,"INS"],[6282,6290,"INS"],[6294,6307,"INS"],[6309,6317,"INS"],[6493,6502,"INS"],[6519,6532,"PERSON"],[6536,6541,"PERSON"],[6543,6556,"PERSON"],[6608,6615,"PERSON"],[7161,7164,"INS"],[7224,7232,"INS"],[7424,7437,"INS"],[7752,7765,"INS"],[8067,8080,"INS"],[8430,8454,"INS"],[8459,8463,"PERSON"],[8531,8555,"INS"],[8807,8816,"INS"],[9262,9271,"INS"],[9573,9577,"INS"],[9615,9624,"INS"],[9628,9641,"PERSON"],[9703,9707,"INS"],[9763,9777,"CASE_NUM"],[10018,10031,"INS"],[10233,10236,"INS"],[10296,10310,"CASE_NUM"],[10371,10393,"INS"],[10484,10498,"CASE_NUM"],[10696,10709,"PERSON"],[10893,10897,"INS"],[11022,11031,"INS"],[11053,11067,"CASE_NUM"],[11083,11092,"PERSON"],[11100,11113,"INS"],[11116,11125,"PERSON"],[11259,11268,"INS"],[11340,11349,"INS"],[11363,11367,"INS"],[11371,11384,"PERSON"],[11387,11391,"INS"],[11407,11420,"PERSON"],[11710,11714,"INS"],[12104,12108,"INS"],[12166,12169,"INS"],[12205,12214,"INS"],[12239,12243,"INS"],[13027,13030,"INS"],[13141,13156,"CASE_NUM"],[13158,13167,"PERSON"],[13171,13176,"PERSON"],[13194,13207,"PERSON"],[13216,13225,"PERSON"],[13231,13235,"INS"],[13349,13357,"INS"],[13378,13387,"PERSON"],[13404,13407,"INS"],[13584,13611,"CASE_NUM"],[13661,13676,"CASE_NUM"],[13736,13749,"INS"],[13774,13795,"CASE_NUM"],[13844,13866,"INS"],[13895,13904,"PERSON"],[13924,13945,"CASE_NUM"],[13975,13984,"PERSON"],[14128,14162,"CASE_NUM"],[14168,14182,"PROM_DATE"],[14184,14217,"CASE_NUM"],[14224,14238,"PROM_DATE"],[14240,14273,"CASE_NUM"],[14280,14291,"PROM_DATE"],[14293,14326,"CASE_NUM"],[14333,14345,"PROM_DATE"],[14347,14380,"CASE_NUM"],[14387,14399,"PROM_DATE"],[14401,14434,"CASE_NUM"],[14441,14453,"PROM_DATE"],[14455,14488,"CASE_NUM"],[14495,14507,"PROM_DATE"],[14509,14542,"CASE_NUM"],[14549,14562,"PROM_DATE"],[14568,14601,"CASE_NUM"],[14608,14620,"PROM_DATE"],[14718,14733,"PROM_DATE"],[14738,14751,"PROM_DATE"],[14903,14912,"PERSON"],[14929,14932,"INS"],[15010,15031,"CASE_NUM"],[15070,15083,"INS"],[15142,15150,"INS"],[15207,15210,"INS"],[15391,15399,"INS"],[15470,15502,"CASE_NUM"],[15626,15639,"INS"],[15935,15939,"INS"],[16001,16014,"INS"],[16194,16198,"INS"],[16441,16445,"INS"],[16508,16514,"INS"],[16591,16595,"INS"],[16654,16658,"INS"],[16985,17006,"INS"],[17059,17065,"PERSON"],[17078,17082,"INS"],[17537,17541,"INS"],[17624,17637,"PERSON"],[17677,17683,"INS"],[17735,17739,"INS"],[18062,18066,"INS"],[18083,18092,"INS"],[18180,18184,"INS"],[18426,18439,"PERSON"],[18441,18456,"PERSON"],[18461,18476,"PERSON"],[18517,18520,"INS"],[18899,18902,"INS"],[19099,19102,"INS"],[19308,19312,"INS"],[19409,19417,"INS"],[19421,19428,"INS"],[19764,19768,"INS"],[20073,20082,"PERSON"],[20086,20091,"PERSON"],[20096,20100,"INS"],[20104,20117,"PERSON"],[20354,20358,"INS"],[20530,20536,"INS"],[20540,20544,"INS"],[20559,20565,"INS"],[20572,20585,"PERSON"],[20589,20594,"PERSON"],[21484,21490,"INS"],[21494,21498,"INS"],[21503,21516,"PERSON"],[21520,21525,"PERSON"],[22113,22121,"INS"],[22238,22242,"INS"],[22522,22535,"INS"],[22539,22571,"CASE_NUM"],[22635,22667,"CASE_NUM"],[22730,22738,"PERSON"],[22762,22769,"PERSON"],
