AGUINALDO, CHAIRPERSON, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nINTING, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Rules of Court filed by Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth) assailing the Commission on Audit (COA) Commission Proper (COA Proper) Decision[2] dated January 29, 2018 and Resolution[3] dated August 15, 2019 in COA CP Case No. 2015-683. In the assailed issuances, the COA Proper affirmed the Notices of Disallowance (NDs) issued by the COA Auditor relative to Philhealth's payment of Educational Assistance Allowance (EAA) and Birthday Gift to its officials and employees in the Head Office (HO) and Regional Offices (RO) during 2014.[4]\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nThe present controversy stems from the COA Auditor's issuance of two NDs[5] disallowing benefits and allowances paid by Philhealth to HO\/RO officials in the aggregate amount of P83,062,385.27 computed[6] as follows:\nBenefit\/Allowance\nAmount\n \nEAA — HO\t\nP51,529,824.29\n \nEAA — NCR and Rizal RO\t\n27,837,560.98\n \nBirthday Gift\t\n3,695,000.00\n \nTotal\t\nP83,062,385.27[7]\n \nThe COA Auditor found that Philhealth granted the EAA and Birthday Gift to its officials without the President's approval, contrary to the requirement set forth under the following legal provisions:[8]\n\n1) Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1597[9]\nSECTION 5. Allowances, Honoraria, and Other Fringe Benefits. — Allowances, honoraria and other fringe benefits which may be granted to government employees, whether payable by their respective offices or by other agencies of government, shall be subject to the approval of the President upon recommendation of the Commissioner of the Budget. For this purpose, the Budget Commission shall review on a continuing basis and shall prepare, for the consideration and approval of the President, policies and levels of allowances and other fringe benefits applicable to government personnel, including honoraria or other forms of compensation for participation in projects which are authorized to pay additional compensation.\n\nSECTION 6. Exemptions from OCPC Rules and Regulations. — Agencies positions, or groups of officials and employees of the national government, including government owned or controlled corporations, who are hereafter exempted by law from OCPC coverage, shall observe such guidelines and policies as may be issued by the President governing position classification, salary rates, levels of allowances, project and other honoraria, overtime rates, and other forms of compensation and fringe benefits.

(Italics supplied)\n6) RA 10149,[14] otherwise known as the GOCC Governance Act of 2011\nSECTION 8. Coverage of the Compensation and Position Classification System. — The GCG, after conducting a compensation study, shall develop a Compensation and Position Classification System which shall apply to all officers and employees of the GOCCs whether under the Salary Standardization Law or exempt therefrom and shall consist of classes of positions grouped into such categories as the GCG may determine, subject to the approval of the President. (Italics supplied)\nWhen the COA Director denied its subsequent appeal from the disallowances, Philhealth[15] elevated the case to the COA Proper.[16]\n\nRuling of the COA Proper\n\nIn its assailed Decision,[17] the COA Proper affirmed the disallowances. It explained as follows:\n\nFirst, based on Eng. Mendoza v. Commission on Audit,[18] it is true that selected entities have been exempted from the application of the SSL by virtue of their charters. These exempted entities were allowed to create their own compensation and position classification systems that apply to their respective offices. However, the charter[19] of Philhealth (Philhealth Charter) does not contain the same express exemption.[20]\n\nSecond, Philhealth's power to fix the compensation of its personnel, as provided under Section 16(n)[21] of the Philhealth Charter, does not expressly grant fiscal autonomy upon the entity. Further, based on Intia, Jr. v. Commission on Audit,[22] the Board of Directors' authority to determine and fix Philhealth personnel's compensation and classification is not absolute. Section 26(a)[23] of the Philhealth Charter mandates that all funds under Philhealth's management and control shall be subject to all rules and regulations applicable to public funds.[24]\n\nThird, even if Philhealth were expressly allowed by its charter to have its own position and compensation plans, it would still be required to report the same to the President of the Philippines through the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).[25]\n\nFourth, contrary to Philhealth's assertion, the subject benefits and allowances are not Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) incentives. Public Sector Labor-Management Council (PSLMC) Resolution No. 04, s. 2002 and Resolution No. 02, s. 2003 defined CNA Incentives as rationalized cash incentives granted under a CNA in favor of government employees who have contributed either in productivity or cost savings in an agency. The subject EAA and Birthday Gift do not fall within this definition and, thus, are regarded as non-negotiable concerns, the payment of which is regulated by law.[26]\n\nFifth, the granting of benefits and allowances by virtue of the resolutions passed by Philhealth in the exercise of its fiscal autonomy, no matter how long practiced, if done in violation of existing rules and regulations, is still considered unauthorized and should be disallowed.[27]\n\nSixth, the claim that former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (President Arroyo) twice confirmed the power of the Board of Directors to fix Philhealth's compensation framework, as provided under Section 16(n) of its Charter, is untenable. The former President only approved the Philhealth Rationalization Plan or Reengineered Organization and its corresponding plantilla positions.[28]\n\nFinally, the COA Proper found that all approving\/certifying officers and recipients of the subject benefits and allowances are liable for the disallowed amounts. On the one hand, the approving\/certifying officers cannot be deemed in good faith, inasmuch as the rules and regulations requiring the prior approval of the Office of the President and the DBM were already existing prior to the grant and payment of the subject benefits and allowances. In fact, several audit disallowances have been previously issued against Philhealth which should have made it more conscious and mindful in paying out employee benefits and allowances.[29] Thus, they are solidarily liable for the disallowed amounts.[30] On the other hand, the payees must return what they have received to prevent unjust enrichment against the government.[31]\n\nThe COA Proper's denial[32] of the subsequent Motion for Reconsideration[33] prompted Philhealth to file the present petition.\n\nPhilhealth's Arguments\n\nPhilhealth cites the following grounds for the allowance of its petition:\nA. SECTION 16(n) OF R.A. NO. 7875, AS AMENDED, EXPLICITLY BESTOWED [PHILHEALTH] WITH \"FISCAL AUTONOMY OR INDEPENDENCE\" TO FIX THE COMPENSATION OF ITS PERSONNEL, AS CONFIRMED BY [THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT CORPORATE GENERAL COUNSEL (OGCC)] OPINIONS, THEN PRESIDENT GLORIA ARROYO, AND LEGISLATIVE DELIBERATIONS ON SECTION 16(n).\n\nB. THE FISCAL AUTHORITY OF [PHILHEALTH] UNDER ARTICLE IV, SECTION 16 (N) OF R.A. NO. 7875, AS AMENDED, HAD BEEN CONFIRMED TWICE BY THEN PRESIDENT GLORIA M. ARROYO, IN 2006 AND IN 2008.\n\nC. [PHILHEALTH] IS CLASSIFIED AS A [GFI] AND MUST BE ACCORDED THE FISCAL AUTONOMY ENJOYED BY OTHER GFIs AS RECOGNIZED BY THIS COURT IN THE CASE OF CENTRAL BANK EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION INC vs. BANGKO SENTRAL NG PILIPINAS.\n\nD. THE DISALLOWED BENEFITS WERE GRANTED PURSUANT TO THE DULY EXECUTED [CNA] BETWEEN [PHILHEALTH] MANAGEMENT AND [PHILHEALTH] EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (PHICEA)\n\nE. THE [PHILHEALTH] OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES RECEIVED THE SUBJECT BENEFITS IN GOOD FAITH AND, THEREFORE, EVEN IF THE DISALLOWANCE IS SUSTAINED, THEY CANNOT BE REQUIRED TO REFUND THE SAME.\n\nF. THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY RULED IN THE CASE OF PHILHEALTH CARAGA VS COMMISSION ON AUDIT [DECISION], G.R. No. 230218, AUGUST 14, 2018, THAT BOTH THE APPROVING OFFICERS AND PASSIVE RECIPIENTS ARE IN GOOD FAITH IN RECEIVING BENEFITS APPROVED BY THE PHILHEALTH BOARD, HENCE, BOTH NEED NOT REFUND THE DISALLOWED BENEFITS.[34]\nPhilhealth relies heavily on its supposed fiscal autonomy and the Board of Directors' authority to fix the compensation of Philhealth personnel to justify the grant and payment of EAA and Birthday Gift. It points out that its fiscal autonomy has been twice confirmed by former President Arroyo and supported by OGCC Opinions. It classifies itself as part of a \"distinct class\" of entities (i.e., GOCCs\/GFIs) that are allowed fiscal autonomy and, thus, exempted from the application of the SSL.\n\nFurther, Philhealth insists that the subject benefits and allowances were incentives paid pursuant to a duly-executed CNA between the management and its personnel.\n\nAs to liability, Philhealth invokes the defense of good faith to excuse the approving officers and payees alike from their obligation in relation to the disallowances.\n\nCOA's Arguments\n\nThe COA, through the Office of the Solicitor General, counters that Philhealth failed to establish grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COA Proper. Unless the assailed COA Proper rulings are ridden with grave abuse of discretion, its inconsequential errors of judgment cannot be reviewed by the Court.[35]\n\nIn any case, it refutes Philhealth's claims as follows: First, Philhealth's power to fix the compensation of its personnel is not unfettered. It is not exempted from the limitations and guidelines provided for by the SSL and other pertinent rules and regulations.[36] Further, the Court already held[37] that without an express exemption in the Philhealth Charter, the GOCC shall comply with the SSL's provisions, as well as other rules and regulations.[38] Second, the subject benefits are non-negotiable concerns that are excluded in CNAs pursuant to PSLMC Resolution No. 04, s. 2002 and Resolution No. 02, s. 2003, supra, and DBM Budget Circular No. 2006-1 dated February 1, 2006.[39] Third, at the time the benefits were granted, there were already existing rules and regulations requiring prior executive approval. Thus, the Philhealth approving officials cannot be regarded as [having acted] in good faith in granting the subject benefits.[40] On the other hand, good faith also does not absolve the payees to refund the benefits erroneously taken.[41]\n\nIssue\n\nDid the COA Proper commit grave abuse of discretion in affirming the disallowances against Philhealth?\n\nThe Courts Ruling\n\nThe petition lacks merit.\n\nAt the onset, it must be stressed that the Court's authority to review COA rulings via Rule 64 is limited to acts that amount to jurisdictional errors or grave abuse of discretion.[42] The Court's intervention is justified only when it is clearly shown that the COA acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.[43] Simple errors of judgment on the part of the COA Proper cannot be cured via certiorari proceedings[44] or reviewed by the Court via Rule 64.[45] Consequently, Philhealth bears the burden of proving \"not merely reversible error\" committed by the COA Proper, but \"such a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.\"[46]\n\nIn the present action, Philhealth invokes repeatedly the concepts of fiscal autonomy, institutional authority to fix personnel compensation, and good faith in its attempt to have the COA rulings overturned. For one, the contentions are a reiteration of those raised before and passed upon by the COA Proper.[47] More importantly, it is obvious that the arguments are not imputations of grave abuse. Assuming that these are proven, the imputations only amount to errors of judgment, which are beyond the scope of the Court's review under Rule 64.[48] To be clear, Philhealth's failure to point out the specific acts of the COA Proper that may constitute grave abuse of discretion in upholding the subject disallowances[49] is sufficient ground to dismiss the present petition.[50]\n\nBe that as it may, even if the Court brushes aside the deficiency in Philhealth's allegations, there is no reason to depart from the COA's rulings.\n\nI\n\nTo recall, the subject disallowances were grounded on the lack of executive approval, as required under the following laws:\n1) Sections 5 and 6 of PD 1597;\n2) Section 12 of the SSL;\n3) Section 3 of MO 20 dated June 25, 2001;\n4) Section 3 of AO 103 dated August 31, 2004;\n5) Section 9 of EO 7 dated September 8, 2010; and\n6) Section 8 of the GOCC Governance Act.\nThe Court observes that Philhealth does not deny that the subject benefits and allowances were granted without executive approval or confirmation. Instead, Philhealth insists that it belongs to a special class of entities exempted from the requirements in the SSL and relevant laws\/regulations,[51] particularly obtaining prior executive approval in relation to the grant and payment of salaries and benefits. It continues to rely on its supposed fiscal autonomy and authority to fix the compensation of its personnel in justifying the grant and in seeking exemption from the application of the SSL. In other words, Philhealth believes that it has a free hand in determining the compensation of its personnel, without the intervention of the executive, and that the resolutions passed by the Board of Directors are sufficient legal bases for the grant and payment of the EAA and Birthday Gift.\n\nHowever, it is already settled that Philhealth does not have absolute discretion in determining the compensation of its officials. In the 2016 Decision in Philippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit,[52] the Court explained at length:\nAccordingly, that Section 16(n) of R.A. 7875 granting PHIC's power to fix the compensation of its personnel does not explicitly provide that the same shall be subject to the approval of the DBM or the OP as in Section 19(d) thereof does not necessarily mean that the PHIC has unbridled discretion to issue any and all kinds of allowances, limited only by the provisions of its charter. As clearly expressed in PCSO v. COA, even if it is assumed that there is an explicit provision exempting a GOCC from the rules of the then Office of Compensation and Position Classification (OCPC) under the DBM, the power of its Board to fix the salaries and determine the reasonable allowances, bonuses and other incentives was still subject to the standards laid down by applicable laws: P.D. No. 985, its 1978 amendment, P.D. No. 1597, the SSL, and at present, R.A. 10149. To sustain petitioners' claim that it is the PHIC, and PHIC alone, that will ensure that its compensation system conforms with applicable law will result in an invalid delegation of legislative power, granting the PHIC unlimited authority to unilaterally fix its compensation structure. Certainly, such effect could not have been the intent of the legislature.[53] (Citations omitted)\nThe Court reiterated its rejection of Philhealth's fiscal autonomy as justification for the payment of allowances and benefits in the following disallowance cases also involving Philhealth:\n(a)\nPhilippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 235832, November 3, 2020;\n\n\n(b)\nPhilippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 222129, February 2, 2021;\n\n\n(c)\nPhilippine Health Insurance Corp. Regional Office-CARAGA v. Commission on Audit (Resolution), G.R. No. 230218, July 6, 2021; and\n\n\n(d)\nPhilippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 250089, November 9, 2021.\nThat Philhealth's fiscal autonomy had been purportedly confirmed by the Chief Executive and the OGCC, as Philhealth argues,[54] cannot undermine the consistent and unequivocal Court pronouncements.\n\nAt this point, there should no longer be any question that Philhealth is not exempted from the application of the SSL. Its power to fix personnel compensation is limited and \"must necessarily yield to the state policy of 'equal pay for equal work.' Thus, any disbursement of allowances and other forms of employee compensation must conform with prevailing rules and regulations issued by the President of the Philippines and\/or the [DBM].\"[55]\n\nTo be sure, the resolutions of the Board of Directors granting the EAA and Birthday Gift sans executive\/DBM review and approval as required under PD No. 985, as amended, PD No. 1597, the SSL, and RA No. 10149 are ultra vires acts,[56] which rendered the subsequent disbursements illegal and irregular.[57] These infractions are substantial. In view of these, there is no more need to elaborate on the same approval requirement reiterated in MO No. 20 and AO No. 103.\n\nII\n\nThe general principle of the SSL is that the basic salary of civil service personnel is deemed to already include all allowances and other forms of additional compensation. By exception, under Section 12 thereof, supra, the following may be paid on top of the standardized basic salary:\n(1)\nrepresentation and transportation allowances, clothing and laundry allowances, subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital personnel, hazard pay, allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad;\n\n\n(2)\nother additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM as non-integrated;[58]\n\n\n(3)\nother additional compensation of a government employee, whether or not integrated, if the employee had been already receiving such additional compensation prior to the SSL's effectivity (i.e., before and as of July 1, 1989).\nIn the present controversy: first, the subject EAA and Birthday Gift are not among the allowable non-integrated allowances expressly enumerated under Section 12; second, Philhealth does not point to any DBM issuance identifying the EAA and Birthday Gift as allowable non­integrated benefits; third, it admits that the grant of EAA commenced in 2000.[59] On the other hand, it claims that the grant of Birthday Gift was made pursuant to the CNA executed and approved in 2010.[60] In other words, the subject benefits were introduced to Philhealth's compensation scheme long after the passage of the SSL.\n\nIt is clear from the foregoing that the EAA and Birthday Gift are not among the exceptions to the standardization of salaries. These are deemed already incorporated in the basic salary of Philhealth personnel. Consequently, \"the unauthorized issuance and receipt of [these benefits are] tantamount to double compensation justifying COA disallowance.\"[61]\n\nIII\n\nThe Court also rejects Philhealth's theory that the subject benefits are valid CNA Incentives. For its part, Philhealth claims that PSLMC Resolution No. 02, s. 2003 allows \"higher incentives to employees\" of GOCCs\/GFIs.[62] The Court finds Philhealth's interpretation of the issuance highly selective.\n\nPSLMC Resolution No. 02, s. 2003[63] expressly states:\nWherefore, the Council resolves as it hereby resolved, to adopt the following guidelines for all GOCCs\/GFIs whether covered by or exempted from the SSL;\n\nSection 1. In recognition of the joint efforts of labor and management to attain more efficient and viable operations, a CNA Incentive may be provided in the CNA to be granted to the rank-and­-file.\n\nSection 2. The CNA must include, among others, provisions on improvement of income and productivity, streamlining of systems and procedures, and cost cutting measures that shall be undertaken by both the management and the union so that the operations of the GOCC\/GFI can be undertaken at a lesser cost.\n\nSection 3. The CNA Incentive may be granted if all the following conditions are met by the GOCC\/GFI: \n \na)\nActual operating income at least meets the targeted operating income in the Corporate Operating Budget (COB) approved by the [DBM]\/Office of the President for the year; For GOCCs\/GFIs, which by nature of their functions consistently incur operating losses, the current year's operating loss should have been minimized or reduced compared to or at most equal that of prior year's level;\n\n\nb)\nActual operating expenses are less than the DBM approved level of operating expenses in the COB as to generate sufficient source of funds for the payment of CNA Incentive; and\n\n\nc)\nFor income generating GOCCs\/GFIs, dividends amounting to at least 50% of their annual earnings have been remitted to the National Treasury in accordance with the provisions of [RA] 7656 dated November 9, 1993. (Italics supplied)\nThe import of the above-cited provisions is that GOCCs\/GFIs do not have the authority to grant CNA Incentives at will. A valid and justified grant turns upon the concurrence of several conditions, thus: that there is a valid CNA between labor and management and that the parties have endeavored to attain more efficient and viable operations. \"Whether the parties have in fact achieved these objectives shall be determined by the criteria and benchmark expressly stipulated by the parties in the CNA, particularly the provisions on the improvement of income and productivity, streamlining of systems and procedures, and cost-cutting measures to be undertaken.\"[64]\n\nForemost, it is basic that CNA incentives are granted specifically to reward good performance and efficiency. However, there appears to be no connection between the grant of the EAA and Birthday Gift and Philhealth's institutional productivity\/performance.\n\nFurthermore, there is nothing in the rollo that establishes whether the essential requisites for a valid CNA Incentive have been met. In particular, Philhealth failed to show whether its management and the relevant collective negotiation unit agreed on specific cost-cutting measures or any plan to improve its operations' efficiency and viability identified therein. When it is unce1iain \"whether cost-cutting measures were installed and\/or implemented or, much more, whether [the GOCC\/GFI] actually reduced its costs and generated the savings required to establish a funding source for its CNA Incentives,\"[65] the grant of CNA Incentives is unjustified.\n\nIV\n\nPhilhealth's payments of EAA and Birthday Gift were also scrutinized in the recent case of Philippine Health Insurance Corp. Regional Office-CARAGA v. Commission on Audit (Resolution).[66] The Court categorically declared that the disbursements of various Philhealth benefits, including the EAA and Birthday Gift lacked legal basis, viz:\nSpecifically, the birthday gifts, educational assistance allowance, contractor's gifts and sustenance allowance, transportation allowance, and shuttle services assistance were allegedly included in the Collective Negotiation Agreement between PhilHealth Employees Association, the duly recognized union of PhilHealth rank-and-file employees, and the PhilHealth management for the year 2007 to 2010.\n\nx x x x\n\nWith respect to the rest of the benefits and incentives, the disbursements lacked legal basis. Again, petitioners failed to present any law or [DBM] issuance authorizing the grant of these benefits and incentives in question. By legal fiction, these disallowed benefits and incentives are deemed incorporated in the standardized salary.[67]\nThe above-mentioned ruling applies squarely to the present controversy.\n\nAll in all, the compendium of disallowance cases involving Philhealth consistently rejects Philhealth's so-called fiscal autonomy as justification for the payment of benefits and allowances to its employees. To be valid, every allowance\/benefit payment shall be supported by a DBM issuance expressly declaring it as non-integrated. Otherwise, succeeding payments of unauthorized allowances or benefits shall be subject to disallowance for being in violation of the general standardization rule under the SSL.\n\nV\n\nThe payees of the EAA and Birthday Gift and the officers who approved and\/or certified the grant\/payment thereof are liable for the disallowance. Their respective liabilities are discussed below.\n\nApproving\/Certifying Officers\n\nThe prevailing rule states that \"[a]pproving and certifying officers who are clearly shown to have acted in bad faith, malice, or gross negligence are, pursuant to Section 43 of the Administrative Code of 1987, solidarily liable to return only the net disallowed amount.\"[68]\n\nVerily, as public officials, these approving\/certifying officers are presumed to have performed their duties regularly and in good faith.[69] However, these presumptions of regularity and good faith are negated when it is shown that the officer did not act with the diligence of a good father of a family.[70] In which case, he\/she shall be liable for all the losses arising out of his\/her negligence or lack of diligence.[71]\n\nIn line with the diligence required of them, approving\/certifying officers are duty-bound to be conversant[72] with the transactions falling within their fiscal responsibility. A prudent approving\/certifying officer is expected to be abreast with prevailing laws and COA regulations, including the latest policy developments, on-going\/previous audit investigations, disallowance proceedings, and COA Proper\/Court rulings that govern or otherwise have an effect on these transactions.\n\nIn the present case, it appears that the COA had been questioning Philhealth's payment of EAA and Birthday Gift as early as 2008. The COA already disallowed these types of disbursements on previous occasions:\n \n(1)\nPHIC NDs 2008-056(07) and 2008-056(07), both dated December 18, 2008, disallowed Birthday Gift and EAA payments, respectively, during calendar year 2007. These disallowances were affirmed by the Court in 2020.[73]\n\n\n(2)\nNDs 09-005-501-(09) to 09-019-501-(09) issued in 2009, disallowed the payment of various benefits to Philhealth CARAGA officers, employees and contractors during calendar year of 2009, which included among others, EAA and Birthday Gift. These disallowances were upheld by the Court in 2018.[74] Notably, Philhealth acknowledges[75] that these 2009 NDs also dealt with the same benefits that are now subject of this controversy.\n\nThe Philhealth officers' respective approvals\/certifications in the case, notwithstanding the above-enumerated 2008\/2009 disallowances that cast doubt over the validity\/regularity of the exact same benefit types now at issue, only tell the Court that they were either ignorant of the investigations\/disallowance proceedings or aware of those developments but chose to turn a blind eye thereto. In the Court's mind, they cannot be regarded to have regularly performed their duties or to have acted in good faith.[76] This was also the Court's ruling in Philippine Health Insurance Corp. Regional Office-CARAGA v. Commission on Audit (Resolution).[77] Consequently, the approving\/certifying officers shall be solidarily liable for the net disallowed amount.\n\nPayees\n\nPhilhealth relies on the August 14, 2018 ruling in Philippine Health Insurance Corp. Regional Office-Caraga v. Commission on Audit (Decision),[78] wherein the Court did not require the payees therein to refund the disallowed amounts on account of their good faith.[79]\n\nHowever, the Court has since reversed the decision exonerating the payees. The Court rejected the defense of good faith and emphasized that payees may be absolved from their liability to refund the corresponding portion of the disallowed amount, by exception, only when the subject disbursements had been adequately supported by factual and legal basis in the first place.[80]\n\nPrevailing jurisprudence stresses that a payee's liability in a disallowance case is quasi-contractual (solutio indebiti):[81] when a disbursement is adjudged to be illegal, irregular, excessive, extravagant, and\/or unconscionable, an individual's receipt of any portion thereof is regarded as erroneous. In Madera v. Commission on Audit,[82] (Madera case) the Court declared that if a disallowance is upheld, the recipients are liable to return the disallowed amount respectively received by them.[83]\n\nIn light of these developments, the Court deems it proper to determine the payees' liability in the present case in accordance with the prevailing framework on the rules of return[84] and consistent with the Court's ruling in Philippine Health Insurance Corp. Regional Office­CARAGA v. Commission on Audit (Resolution), supra.\n\nOn account of the nature of their liability, payees cannot be exempted therefrom by mere invocation of the good faith defense. They may be excused from this obligation only when: (1) they are able to show that the amounts they received were genuinely given in consideration of the services rendered (Rule 2c of Madera case), or (2) the Court excuses them based on undue prejudice, social justice considerations, or the bona fide exceptions as will be determined on a case-to-case basis (Rule 2d of Madera case).[85]\n\nAnd as later clarified in Abellanosa v. Commission on Audit,[86] a payee may benefit from exception under Rule 2c of Madera case only when the following conditions concur: (a) if the personnel incentive or benefit has proper basis in law but is only disallowed due to irregularities that are merely procedural in nature; and (b) the personnel incentive or benefit must have a clear, direct, and reasonable connection to the actual performance of the payee recipient's official work and functions for which the benefit or incentive was intended as further compensation.[87]\n\nThe Court does not find any of the above-mentioned exceptions to be availing in the present case. First, the payments of EAA and Birthday Gift lack legal basis. As discussed above, these were granted ultra vires and cannot be classified as valid CNA Incentives (Rule 2c of Madera case). Second, there are no circumstances in the present case that compel the Court to excuse herein payees (Rule 2d of Madera case). In these lights, they must refund the corresponding amounts received in error.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED. The COA Proper Decision dated January 29, 2018 and Resolution dated August 15, 2019 in COA CP Case No. 2015-683 are AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nLeonen,** Acting C.J., Caguioa, Hernando, Lazaro-Javier, Zalameda, Gaerlan, Rosario, J.

{"id":2,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 257276, February 28, 2022 ]\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX[1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nHERNANDO, J.:\n\nThis resolves the appeal[2] filed by accused-appellant XXX (accused-appellant) assailing the November 25, 2020 Decision[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB CR. HC. No. 03295. Accused-appellant was charged with Qualified Rape under the following Information:\nThat on or about the 8th day of August 2009 in the xxxxxxxxxxx,[4] and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with [AAA],[5] a minor 7 years old (sic) aggravated by relationship, the accused being the uncle of the victim because accused is the brother of the victim's father.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.[6]\nAccused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge against him.[7] The defense admitted the authenticity and due execution of complainant AAA's temporary medical certificate. The said document, along with AAA's baptismal certificate and birth certificate, was admitted as documentary evidence.[8] The prosecution presented the testimonies of AAA, her mother BBB, and Dr. Rufina Leonor Barrot Gler (Dr. Gler). The records of the stenographic notes of the said witnesses were lost due to the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda; thus, the retaking of testimonies of the said witnesses was conducted, except for Dr. Gler's.[9] However, the defense admitted the authenticity and due execution of the temporary medical report and final medico-legal report.[10]\n\nVersion of the prosecution:\n\nAAA recounted that at around 7:00 p.m. of August 8, 2009, she was inside their house when accused-appellant, her uncle who lived with them, summoned her inside his room. Upon entering accused-appellant's room, accused-appellant pulled down her shirt, removed her panty, and undressed himself by removing his pants, brief, and t-shirt. Accused-appellant proceeded to kiss AAA on the lips, then laid her down on the bed. He subsequently mounted AAA and inserted his penis inside her vagina.[11] The latter felt pain in her vagina and informed accused-appellant about it, which caused him to stop his actions. Accused-appellant stood up, put on his clothes and directed AAA to do the same. She put on her clothes and both of them then sat on the bed side by side. At this point, accused-appellant unzipped his pants and ordered AAA to suck his penis. Due to his threat that he will kill her if she does not comply with his orders, AAA followed his order. After 30 minutes of satisfying his desires, accused-appellant told her to get out of his room.[12] AAA was only seven years old at the time of the incident.[13] She further testified that accused-appellant also raped her prior to the incident.[14]\n\nOn the same night, BBB was grilling fish inside their house and called for AAA to help her. However, she did not reply. BBB went out to look for her daughter. While BBB was passing through accused-appellant's window, she saw that accused-appellant was kissing her daughter and that her daughter was holding accused-appellant's penis, running her fingers on it in an up and down motion.[15] BBB rushed to enter her house and saw her daughter coming out of accused-appellant's room. Upon seeing her mother, AAA informed her that accused-appellant sexually abused her and threatened to kill her if she does not follow his orders. Upon hearing this, BBB informed her husband, and they immediately proceeded to the xxxxxxxxxxx Police Community Precinct to report the rape incident against accused-appellant. After reporting the incident, they brought AAA to the hospital to undergo a medical examination.[16]\n\nDr. Florence J. Curbilla, the gynecologist who examined AAA, discovered that there was an abrasion on the labia majora and an old healed incomplete hymenal laceration at the 11:00 o'clock position, but her vaginal discharge did not contain any spermatozoa. Dr. Curbilla's findings were contained in the medico-legal report.[17]\n\nVersion of the Defense:\n\nFor his part, accused-appellant denied having raped AAA and claimed that he was sleeping in his house at the time of the incident. His house was adjacent to the house of AAA. While he was sleeping, two police officers went to his house, awakened him, and informed him that someone has complained that he committed rape. BBB accompanied the police officers.[18] He admitted that he was AAA's uncle, since her father is his brother.[19] While he noted that the only possible motive against him is a land dispute between the siblings, he stated that he was very close to AAA's parents, who treated him well and had no reason to charge him with sexual abuse.[20]\n\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court (RTC):\n\nOn February 20, 2019, the RTC, Branch 7 of xxxxxxxxxxx, convicted accused-appellant of Qualified Rape. The RTC accorded great weight to the victim's straightforward and positive testimony, which was corroborated by BBB's testimony, over accused-appellant's negative and self-serving account.[21] The RTC also noted that the fact that the victim was only seven years old at the time of the incident and that the accused-appellant is her uncle was sufficiently proven.[22] The fallo of the RTC's judgment reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused [XXX] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Rape. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole and to pay the private offended party \"AAA\" P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, with all such amounts to earn interest of 6% per annum from the finality of this decision until full payment.\n\nx x x x\n\nSO ORDERED.[23]\nIn his appeal, accused-appellant decried the RTC's finding of guilt, and argued that the RTC erred in giving weight and credence to the testimony of AAA. Accused-appellant argued that there are glaring inconsistencies in AAA's and BBB's testimonies, noting further that BBB's supposed reaction of not rushing to the aid of her daughter in a dreadful situation is incredulous. Accused-appellant likewise maintained that his relationship to AAA was not duly proven.[24] On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General averred that accused-appellant's guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and maintained that the complainant's credible and straightforward testimony must prevail over the bare denials of the accused-appellant. [25]\n\nRuling of the Court of Appeals:\n\nIn its November 25, 2020 Decision, the CA modified the designation of the crime committed from Qualified Rape to Statutory Rape. The CA agreed that the prosecution sufficiently established AAA's minority at the time of the incident and the presence of the elements of Statutory Rape, and that AAA's clear and convincing testimony deserves full weight and credence. However, the CA observed that the allegation of relationship between AAA and accused-appellant under the Information is insufficient under prevailing jurisprudence.[26] The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Judgment dated 20 February 2019 of the Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, Branch 7, in Criminal Case No. 2009-08-363 finding accused-appellant [XXX] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of statutory rape is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. [XXX] is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\nThe award of damages must earn 6% per annum computed from finality of the Court's Decision until satisfied.\n\nSO ORDERED.[27]\nHence, this appeal.[28]\n\nOur Ruling\n\nAfter a careful review of the records, the Court holds that the appeal is bereft of merit.\n\nIn the review of rape cases, We continue to be guided by the following principles: (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility, it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant is scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense. Thus, in a prosecution for rape, the complainant's credibility becomes the single most important issue.[29]\n\nConsidering the foregoing, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the courts a quo that the elements of Statutory Rape were duly established. AAA's straightforward and positive testimony that accused-appellant raped her was corroborated by BBB's testimony. When considered together with the medico-legal certificate indicating an abrasion on her labia majora and AAA's birth certificate proving that she was seven years old at the time of the incident, the prosecution's evidence is sufficient for conviction. It is settled that the crime of rape is deemed consummated even when the man's penis merely enters or comes into contact to the labia or lips of the female organ.[30] Further, the trial court's assessment on the credibility of witnesses deserves great weight, and even conclusive and binding effect, unless the same is tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence, since the trial court is in a better position than the appellate court to properly evaluate testimonial evidence. The rule finds an even more stringent application where the CA sustained said findings, as in this case.[31]\n\nMoreover, AAA's testimony is clear, candid, consistent in its material points, and unshaken during cross-examination. When the offended party is of tender age and immature, courts are inclined to give credit to her account of what transpired, considering not only her relative vulnerability, but also the shame to which she would be exposed if the matter to which she testified is not true.[32] Thus, accused-appellant's defense of denial cannot overcome the categorical testimony of the victim. Denial is an intrinsically weak defense which must be buttressed with strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility. A denial, which necessarily constitutes self-serving negative evidence, cannot prevail over the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.[33]\n\nHowever, contrary to the finding of the CA, We hold that the special qualifying circumstance of relationship was sufficiently alleged in the Information. Indeed, the minority of the victim and his or her relationship with the offender should both be alleged in the Information and proven beyond reasonable doubt during trial in order to qualify the rape charge as these circumstances have the effect of altering the nature of the rape and its corresponding penalty.[34] If the offender is merely a relation — not a parent, ascendant, step-parent, or guardian or common-law spouse of the mother of the victim — it must be alleged in the information that he is \"a relative by 'consanguinity or affinity (as the case may be) within the third civil degree.\" The allegation that accused-appellant is the uncle of AAA, and a brother of AAA's father, without specifically alleging that such relationship was within the third civil degree, is specific enough to satisfy the special qualifying circumstance of relationship.[35] In People v. XXX,[36] the Court considered the qualifying circumstance of relationship even without the specific allegation that the same was within the third civil degree of consanguinity or affinity, since the information therein already described the offender as the \"maternal uncle\" of the victim. In the same manner, the Information in the instant case contained a statement that \"the accused being the uncle of victim because accused is the brother of the victim's father.\"[37] Hence, accused-appellant can be properly convicted of Qualified Rape.\n\nIn sum, accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Rape. Thus, he was properly meted out the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole.[38] The CA's awards of P75,000.00 each as civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages are increased to P100,000.00 each to conform to prevailing jurisprudence.[39] All damages awarded shall earn six percent (6%) interest per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment.\n\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The November 25, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB CR. HC. No. 03295 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that accused-appellant XXX is found GUILTY of Qualified Rape and sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. He is ordered to pay AAA (i) P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, (ii) P100,000.00 as moral damages, and (iii) P100,000.00 as exemplary damages. Interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be imposed on the aggregate amount of the monetary awards computed from the finality of this Decision until full payment.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPerlas-Bernabe, (Chairperson), Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.","label":[[18,32,"CASE_NUM"],[35,52,"PROM_DATE"],[55,80,"INS"],[149,160,"PERSON"],[294,315,"INS"],[319,348,"CASE_NUM"],[1214,1254,"PERSON"],[1449,1457,"PERSON"],[3549,3574,"INS"],[3732,3756,"PERSON"],[3989,4001,"PERSON"],[4760,4780,"INS"],[4815,4818,"INS"],[4896,4899,"INS"],[5089,5092,"INS"],[5277,5280,"INS"],[5870,5873,"INS"],[5914,5917,"INS"],[6316,6347,"INS"],[6586,6602,"INS"],[6644,6646,"INS"],[6738,6740,"INS"],[6983,6985,"INS"],[7170,7172,"INS"],[7270,7290,"INS"],[7333,7362,"CASE_NUM"],[7739,7744,"INS"],[7871,7876,"INS"],[8605,8610,"INS"],[9692,9694,"INS"],[10576,10578,"INS"],[11581,11586,"INS"],[12295,12297,"INS"],[12666,12682,"INS"],[12685,12715,"CASE_NUM"],[13237,13251,"PERSON"],[13268,13276,"PERSON"],[13278,13285,"PERSON"],[13291,13298,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":3,"text":"FIRST DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 236827, April 19, 2022 ]\nELIZABETH A. ALBERTO, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE LUIS R. ALBERTO AND REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nINTING, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] praying that the Decision[2] dated June 30, 2017 and the Resolution[3] dated January 3, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 107159 be reversed and set aside. The CA overturned the Decision[4] dated January 8, 2016 of Branch 94, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Quezon City in Civil Case No. Q-09-65639 and dismissed the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage filed by Elizabeth A. Alberto (Elizabeth).\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nElizabeth and Jose Luis R. Alberto (Jose) met in Madrid, Spain in 1995, where Elizabeth was working as Cultural Assistant of the Philippine Embassy and where Jose was studying for a master's degree. After joining several group dates, the two broke up with their respective partners and became sweethearts. They lived together in Madrid from 1996 to 1997; at that time, Jose had to return to the Philippines to look for work. On January 14, 1998, while Elizabeth was on vacation in the Philippines, the two got married in San Fernando, Pampanga. Two days later, Elizabeth flew back to Madrid, while Jose was left behind because of his job.[5]\n\nJose visited Elizabeth in Spain from December 1998 until January 1999. Soon, Elizabeth became pregnant and gave birth to their first child, Joaquin Carlos A. Alberto (Joaquin Carlos), on September 18, 1999.[6]\n\nAccording to Elizabeth, even before they got married, she noticed that Jose was irresponsible—he would get drunk until he passes out; he would also smoke cigarettes and marijuana; and he had bouts of depression. However, she overlooked all these shortcomings and hoped that she could change him for the better.[7]\n\nWhile Elizabeth was working in Madrid, Jose had an affair with a certain Joyce David (Joyce). Elizabeth saw in Jose's cellular phone romantic and erotic messages from Joyce.[8] Joyce also sent letters and a picture of her and Jose to Elizabeth; she told the latter that it was useless for her to stop the affair because Jose \"craves\" for her (Joyce) in bed. Jose confirmed his relationship with Joyce and promised to stop it. But after that, Jose would seldom come home. Elizabeth also learned that Jose and Joyce had sexual intercourse in front of Joaquin Carlos.[9]\n\nAfter Jose confessed and promised to end the affair,[10] Elizabeth gave him another chance. In 2002, they planned to go to Canada where she was assigned. But Jose was unhappy, and his behavior made it difficult for Elizabeth to recover from the hurts of the past. After giving birth to their second child, Ma. Teresa A. Alberto, in April 2003, Elizabeth no longer slept in the same room with Jose and had no sexual contact with him since then.[11] The two eventually parted ways in 2008; Jose stopped communicating and giving support to Elizabeth and their children.[12]\n\nElizabeth asserted that during their cohabitation as husband and wife, Jose fell short of his financial obligations as he was often without a job. He would get depressed and sleep for long hours. He would rely on her to make decisions in the household. He did not care for the children even when they were sick, and he did not attend their school activities. He even physically hurt their eldest child to get him to obey his orders.[13]\n\nClinical psychologist Dr. Rowena R. Belen (Dr. Belen) identified the report[14] she prepared based on tests conducted on Elizabeth, as well as on interviews with Elizabeth and the children. She also tried to get in touch with Jose, but was unable to do so.[15]\n\nBased on her evaluation, Dr. Belen concluded that Jose has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. This is shown by the following: (1) his failure to stay long in any job that did not suit his standards; (2) his defiance to conventional\/moral rules, as he engaged in a sexual affair with another woman and disregarded his vow to his wife, just to satisfy his desires; (3) his careless disregard for the rights of others especially those of his wife and children for his constant support; (4) his shameless neglect of his wife and children; (5) his interpersonal exploitative tendencies as he used other people, especially his wife to enhance himself and satisfy his needs; (6) his grandiose sense of self-importance and strong sense of entitlement, as he expects to be recognized and be given special favors without assuming reciprocal responsibilities; and (7) his constant need for attention.[16]\n\nDr. Belen declared that the root cause of Jose's personality can be traced to his childhood. He came from a wealthy and politically influential family; thus, he was pampered with material things. But he was deprived of attention and affection as his parents were too busy. Such personality, which was already in existence since childhood, is grave as it impairs him to handle the demands of interpersonal adjustment. He sees nothing wrong with himself, and thus, he remains impervious to change and improvement.[17]\n\nJenelyn Abeleda (Abeleda), a family friend, also testified that she has known Elizabeth and Jose for a long time and had witnessed how Jose was irresponsible to his wife and children. She also saw Jose outside a club in Manila embracing another woman.[18]\n\nThe RTC Ruling\n\nOn January 8, 2016, the RTC rendered its Decision:[19]\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:\nDeclaring the marriage of petitioner Elizabeth A. Alberto and respondent Jose Luis R. Alberto solemnized in San Fernando, Pampanga on January 14, 1998 null and void ab initio on account of the psychological incapacity of the respondent with all the effects thereof as provided by law;\n\nAllowing the petitioner to use her maiden name \"Andrada\";\n\nDissolving the absolute community property and directing that the properties covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-959139 and Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1270023 be liquidated in accordance with Article 147 of the Family Code. The decree of absolute nullity shall be issued only after the compliance with the rules on liquidation, partition and distribution of properties;\n\nAwarding custody of the minors Joaquin Carlos Andrada Alberto and Maria Teresa Andrada Alberto to the petitioner with visitation rights granted to the respondent;\n\nDirecting petitioner and respondent to jointly support Joaquin Carlos Andrada Alberto and Maria Teresa Andrada Alberto in accordance with their means and the needs of the latter;\n\nOrdering the Civil Registrar of San Fernando, Pampanga, City Civil Registrar of Quezon City and the Philippine Statistics Authority (formerly National Statistics Office) to record this Decision after it has become final and executory in accordance with law.\nPursuant to Sec 19(2) A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC (Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages), let the dispositive portion of the decision by published, at the expense of the petitioner, once in a newspaper of general circulation, to be chosen by raffle.\n\nLet a copy of this decision be furnished by registered mail to the last known address of the respondent.\n\nSO ORDERED.[20]\nThe RTC held that the totality of evidence presented showed that Jose is psychologically incapacitated to fulfill his marital obligations.[21] It found that Jose's personality disorder is characterized by juridical antecedence, as it existed long before he and Elizabeth got married; permanent, as it is deeply imbedded in his personality; and grave, as it renders him psychologically incapacitated to perform his essential marital obligations.[22]\n\nThe Republic filed a Motion for Reconsideration,[23] but the RTC denied it.[24]\n\nThe CA Ruling\n\nThe Republic then elevated the case to the CA. It argued that the evidence presented in court was biased, as it was based on the examinations done on Elizabeth. It also failed to prove the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the alleged psychological incapacity of Jose.[25]\n\nOn June 30, 2017, the CA reversed the RTC; thus:\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated January 8, 2016 and the Order dated April 29, 2016 of the RTC, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 94, Quezon City, are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage is DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED.[26]\nElizabeth moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied the motion on January 3, 2018.[27]\n\nThe Petition\n\nElizabeth now comes before the Court with the following issues:\nI. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT A QUO DEVIATED FROM ESTABLISHED JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT DID NOT GIVE CREDENCE TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION REPORT OF THE PETITIONER.\n\nIL WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT A QUO DEVIATED FROM ESTABLISHED JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT BRUSHED ASIDE THE FINDINGS AND EVALUATION MADE BY THE TRIAL COURT.\n\nIII. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT A QUO DEVIATED FROM ESTABLISHED JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT RULED THAT PETITIONER FAILED TO PROVE THAT RESPONDENT HAS PSYCHOLOGICAL INCAPACITY.[28]\nInitially, the Court issued a Resolution[29] dated June 25, 2018 finding no reversible error in the CA Decision. On motion for reconsideration[30] and in light of recent jurisprudence, the Court reinstated the petition.[31]\n\nThe Issue\n\nThe issue to be resolved is whether the petition for declaration of nullity of Elizabeth's marriage with Jose should be granted.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nThe petition has merit.\n\nArticle 36[32] of the Family Code of the Philippines recognizes psychological incapacity of a spouse as a ground to void a marriage.\n\nThrough the landmark case of Tan-Andal v. Andal[33] (Tan-Andal), the Court has clarified that psychological incapacity is neither a mental incapacity nor a personality disorder that must be proven through expert opinion. In addition, the Court declared:\nThere must be proof, however, of the durable or enduring aspects of a person's personality, called \"personality structure,\" which manifests itself through clear acts of dysfunctionality that undermines the family. The spouse's personality structure must make it impossible for him or her to understand and, more important, to comply with his or her essential marital obligations.[34]\nIt is the plaintiff-spouse who has the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence the existence of psychological incapacity. \"Clear and convincing evidence\" is more than \"preponderant\" but less than \"proof beyond reasonable doubt,\" following the presumption of validity of marriages.[35]\n\nAlso, the alleged psychological incapacity must be shown to be grave, incurable, and juridically antecedent.[36]\n\n\"Gravity\" is understood to be the incapacity caused by a genuinely serious psychic cause. It need not be a serious or dangerous illness. However, \"mild characterological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts\" are excluded. It is not mere \"refusal, neglect, or difficulty, much less ill will.\"[37]\n\n\"Incurability\" meanwhile should be viewed in its legal, and not medical, sense. Since psychological incapacity is not medically an illness, it is not something to be cured. The incapacity however must be so enduring and persistent with respect to a specific partner, and contemplates a situation where the couple's respective personality structures are so incompatible and antagonistic that the only result in the union would be the inevitable and irreparable breakdown of the marriage. There must be an undeniable pattern of such persisting failure to be a present, loving, faithful, respectful and supportive spouse, so as to demonstrate that there is indeed a psychological anomaly or incongruity in the spouse relative to the other.[38]\n\nFinally, it must be \"juridically antecedent.\" This means that the psychological incapacity must be existing at the time of the celebration of the marriage, even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. It is an accepted principle in psychology that a person's behavior is determined by the interaction of certain genetic predispositions and by his or her environment. Proof of juridically antecedent psychological incapacity may therefore consist of testimonies describing the environment where the supposedly incapacitated spouse lived that may have led to a particular behavior.[39]\n\nCases have also given weight to trial court's findings and evaluation on the existence or non-existence of a party's psychological incapacity. This is in recognition of their unique position of having observed and examined the demeanor of witnesses as they testified in court.[40]\n\nGuided by these principles, the Court finds that the RTC was correct in granting Elizabeth's petition.\n\nSufficiency of evidence before the RTC\n\nIn reversing the RTC, the CA held that \"the testimonies of Elizabeth, Abeleda, and Belen, as well as the latter's psychological report, did not sufficiently prove the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the alleged psychological incapacity of Jose.\"[41] It found Dr. Belen's report, in particular, to be without \"factual basis other than the biased information supplied by Elizabeth herself.\"[42]\n\nAs the Court clarified in Tan-Andal, proof of the aspects of personality of the spouses need not be given by an expert. Ordinary witnesses who have known the spouses before the latter contracted marriage may testify on behavior that they have consistently observed from the supposedly incapacitated spouse. From these, the judge will decide if the behaviors are indicative of a true and serious incapacity to assume the essential marital obligations.[43] In this way, the intent to limit the incapacity to \"psychic causes\" is fulfilled and there will be no need to label a person as having a mental disorder just to obtain a decree of nullity.[44]\n\nBecause psychological incapacity is not a medical illness that has to be medically or clinically identified, expert opinion is not required.[45]\n\nWhen they are present and made available, however, courts must give due regard to expert opinion, particularly on the parties' psychological and mental disposition.[46] The presentation of expert testimony to prove that a person is suffering from an incurable mental illness, while dispensable, may be deemed as compelling evidence in resolving the issue of psychological incapacity.[47]\n\nIn any event, each case must be judged according to its own facts, guided by the findings of experts and researchers in psychological disciplines, among others.[48]\n\nIt should also be stressed that the fact that the respondent-spouse was not interviewed by the psychologist does not lessen the weight of the latter's report.\n\nCases even prior to Tan-Andal have already settled that experts' findings on either of the spouses' psychological incapacity obtained from direct, personal examination is not an absolute and indispensable requirement. As the nature of marriage is a relation between two individuals, information obtained from either party to the marriage may suffice to inform an expert's assessment. Lack of personal examination and interview of the respondent, does not per se invalidate the testimonies of the doctors. Neither do their findings automatically constitute hearsay that would result in its exclusion as evidence.[49]\n\nAs the Court held in Zamora v. Court of Appeals,[50] the examination of the person by a physician in order for the former to be declared psychologically incapacitated is not a requirement. What is important is the presence of evidence that can adequately establish the party's psychological condition. If the totality of evidence presented is enough to sustain a finding of psychological incapacity, then actual medical examination of the person concerned need not be resorted to.[51] Absence of personal examination is not fatal so long as the totality of evidence sufficiently supports a finding of psychological incapacity.[52]\n\nHere, Dr. Belen tried to get in touch with Jose, but the letter she sent him was returned unserved. She then based her report on her interviews with Elizabeth and the couple's children, as well as on the results of the various psychological tests[53] conducted on Elizabeth.\n\nParenthetically, Elizabeth alleges in the present petition that she filed on November 24, 2017 a Motion to Admit Reply with Attached Reply (To the Comment dated September 26, 2017)[54] before the CA, where she submitted another psychological evaluation report, this time performed by Dr. Jorge Elias Adamos (Dr. Adamos) on Jose, with Jose himself and his brother, Jorge Alberto, as informants. Dr. Adamos' findings largely corroborate Dr. Belen 's conclusion that Jose has Narcissistic Personality Disorder.[55] The CA, however, made no pronouncement regarding Dr. Adamos' report in its Order dated January 3, 2018.[56] Neither did the Office of the Solicitor General discuss this matter in its Comment before the Court dated September 5, 2019.[57]\n \nJose's condition was attended by gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability.\n \n\nBased on the testimonies of Elizabeth and Dr. Belen, Jose's psychological incapacity stems from the family environment and relationship he was exposed to during his childhood. He grew up pampered and showered with material possessions. He was praised but was denied affection and attention by his parents. This made him extremely insecure, self-centered, and boastful.[58]\n\nThis personality is deeply imbedded in Jose's system. And because he sees nothing wrong in himself, he is not receptive to change and improvement.[59]\n\nAs found by the RTC, Jose has already shown his propensity to abuse substances even before he and Elizabeth got married. He is unable to stay long in any job, despite his high academic accomplishments, and failed to provide or even contribute financially to the family. Rather than striving for his wife and kids, he fell into several bouts of depression; he slept for long hours at home; and he withdrew from his responsibilities as he relied heavily on Elizabeth to make decisions for the family. He also failed to fulfill his obligations as a father as he did not participate in the kids' school activities, did not care for them when they were sick, and even resorted to physical punishment.[60]\n\nHe engaged in extra-marital relations despite having been given by Elizabeth chances to reform.[61] He even had sexual intercourse with his mistress in front of the couple's minor child,[62] which shows not only his perversity but also his lack of understanding, if not absolute callousness, and disregard for his fundamental duties to his wife and children. As if this was not enough, his extra-marital affair even subjected his wife to ridicule, taunting, and mockery from his mistress.[63] Consistent with his disregard and lack of concern for his responsibilities as a husband and father, Jose has neither communicated with Elizabeth and the children nor given them any financial support since their separation in 2008.[64]\n\nBased on the totality of evidence in this case, the Court finds that Elizabeth was able to show that Jose was psychologically incapacitated at the time he got married to her and remained to be so thereafter. He is non-cognitive of the basic marital covenants such as respect, fidelity, mutual love, help, and support to each other.\n\nThe RTC was correct in granting Elizabeth's petition to declare her marriage with Jose null and void ab initio on the ground of psychological capacity.\n\nThe Court has previously held that the dissolution of marital bonds on the ground of the psychological incapacity of either spouse does not amount to a demolition of the foundation of families. There is actually no marriage to speak of since it is void from the beginning.[65] Inasmuch as the Constitution regards marriage as an inviolable social institution and the foundation of the family, courts must not hesitate to void marriages that are patently ill-equipped by reason of psychic causes inherent in the person of the spouses.[66]\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.

FENIS, AND CONSOLIDATED BUILDING MAINTENANCE, INC., RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nINTING, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated September 30, 2016 and the Resolution[3] dated March 3, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 142490. The assailed Decision and Resolution reversed and set aside the Resolutions dated June 25, 2015[4] and July 28, 2015[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC No. 04-001027-15 and held that respondent Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc.[6] (CBMI) is a labor-only contractor; while Philippine Pizza, Inc. (petitioner) is the employer of Elvis C. Tumpang, Joel L. Ramo, and Ruel C. Fenis (collectively, respondents).\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nPetitioner is a domestic corporation and the franchisee and operator of the Pizza Hut chain of restaurants.[7]\n\nOn the other hand, CBMI is a corporation engaged in the business of providing janitorial, kitchen, messengerial, elevator maintenance, and allied services to various clients, such as petitioner.[8]\n\nOn January 10, 2014, respondents filed a complaint for regularization[9] with the Labor Arbiter (LA); they alleged in their Sama­Samang Sinumpaang Salaysay[10] that petitioner hired them as delivery riders sometime in 2003, 2004, and 2008, respectively.[11] According to respondents, they became regular employees of petitioner in view of the years of service they rendered as delivery riders, a job necessary and desirable to petitioner's business.[12]\n\nMoreover, respondents averred that CBMI is a labor-only contractor as it was petitioner which exercised control and supervision over them[13] and owned the tools and motorcycles they used in the performance of their duties.[14]\n\nRuling of the LA\n\nIn the Decision[15] dated February 23, 2015, the LA decided in favor of petitioner and dismissed the complaint for regularization[16] filed by respondents for lack of merit.[17]\n\nAccording to the LA, respondents failed to prove that petitioner: (1) exercised control and supervision over the means and methods of their work[18]; and (2) it owned the motorcycles which respondents used in the performance of their duties.[19]\n\nIn contrast, the LA found that it was CBMI which exercised all the aspects of being an employer over respondents through its Supervisor, Antonio Ortañez (Ortañez).[20] The LA further found that CBMI is a legitimate job contractor, and consequently, the employer of respondents.[21]\n\nAggrieved, respondents appealed to the NLRC.[22]\n\nRuling of the NLRC\n\nIn the Resolution[23] dated June 25, 2015, the NLRC dismissed the appeal of respondents and agreed with the LA that CBMI is a legitimate job contractor, and hence, the employer of respondents.[24]\n\nRespondents moved to reconsider the ruling of the NLRC,[25] but the latter denied it in the Resolution[26] dated July 28, 2015.\n\nAggrieved, respondents elevated the case before the CA via a Petition for Certiorari[27] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court; they ascribed grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC.[28]\n\nRuling of the CA\n\nIn the assailed Decision[29] dated September 30, 2016, the CA ruled in favor of respondents and CBMI, and held that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the ruling of the LA that CBMI was a legitimate job contractor.[30] According to the CA, CBMI is a labor-only contractor as respondents' duties as delivery riders were necessary and desirable in the usual trade and business of petitioner.[31] In holding so, the CA brushed aside the Affidavit[32] of Ortañez and the stipulations set forth in the Contract of Services[33] between petitioner and CBMI. The CA explained:\n[W]hat were indicated in the contract are mere general statements and those contained in the affidavit are only an enumeration of the functions of the CBMI supervisor. Their statements failed to cite specific instances where CBMI exercised actual control over petitioners, i.e., logbook of store visits, detailed daily work assignments, incident reports, memoranda regarding attendance, performance and punctuality, or appraisal of performance. Proof on the manner and method used in supervision and control are lacking.[34]\nAggrieved, petitioner and CBMI moved to reconsider the Decision of the CA,[35] but the latter denied it on March 3, 2017.[36] Hence, the instant petition.\n\nPetitioner imputes error on the part of the CA in holding that it is the employer of respondents and argues that CBMI is the actual employer of respondents for being a legitimate job contractor.\n\nIn its Comment[37] on the petition, CBMI concurs with petitioner and invokes the case laws of CBMI v. Asprec[38] (Asprec) and PPI v. Cayetano[39] (Cayetano) which held that CBMI is a legitimate job contractor.\n\nIn the Resolution[40] dated October 13, 2021, the Court required petitioner to file its reply. In its Reply,[41] petitioner eleborates that CBMI is a legitimate job contractor and was declared as such by case laws.\n\nIssue\n\nThe issue to be resolved in the case is whether CBMI is a legitimate job contractor and the employer of respondents.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nWhile the Court may resolve only questions of law in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, an exception may be made when the factual findings of the CA and the labor tribunals are contradictory, such as in the case.[42] Here, the labor tribunals found that CBMI was a legitimate job contractor, and consequently, the employer of respondents.[43] On the other hand, the CA held that CBMI was a labor-only contractor as respondents' duties as delivery riders were necessary and desirable in the usual trade and business of petitioner.[44]\n\nEqually important, \"in a Rule 45 review in labor cases, the Court examines the CA's Decision from the prism of whether [in a petition for certiorari,] the latter had correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC's Decision.\"[45]\n\nThere is grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.[46] Such grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC warrants the grant of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari.[47] \n \nThe CA erred in imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC. The status of CBMI as a legitimate job contractor is supported by substantial evidence and, in fact, settled by case laws.\n \n\nIn Department of Transportation and Communication v. Cruz,[48] the Court explained the concept of stare decisis, viz.:\nStare decisis simply means that for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the first principle of justice that, absent any powerful countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike. Thus, where the same questions relating to the same event have been put forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court, the rule of stare decisis is a bar to any attempt to relitigate the same issue.[49]\nThat CBMI is a legitimate job contractor had long been resolved in the cases of Asprec[50] and Cayetano.[51]\n\nThe facts in Asprec and Cayetano are significantly similar to the facts at bar. Like herein respondents who claim that petitioner hired them as delivery riders in 2003,[52] 2004,[53] and 2008,[54] respectively,[55] the employees in Asprec and Cayetano also alleged the following: (1) petitioner initially hired them as team members\/delivery riders sometime between 2000 to 2010;[56] (2) to prevent the employees in Asprec and Cayetano from becoming regular employees, petitioner transferred them as well to CBMI;[57] (3) later on, CBMI deployed them to various branches of petitioner to perform their usual duties as team members\/delivery riders;[58] (4) for having been suspended, temporarily laid off, or placed on floating status, they filed actions for regularization and\/or illegal dismissal against petitioner.[59]\n\nIn Asprec, the Court explained the circumstances as to why CBMI is considered as a legitimate job contractor, viz.:\nThe resolution of the first issue hinges on the determination of the status of CBMI, i.e., whether or not it is a labor-only contractor or an independent contractor.\n\nIn support of its position that it is engaged in legitimate job contracting, CBMI attached for the Court's reference, its Certificate of Registration with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Furthermore, it cites that it has been in operation for almost 50 years, counting various institutions among its clients.\n\nUnder the premises and based on the evidence presented by the parties, the Court is inclined to sustain the position of CBMI that it is an independent contractor.\n\nx x x x\n\nIt is not disputed that CBMI is a duly licensed labor contractor by the DOLE. xxx The Certificate of Registration issued by DOLE recognizes CBMI as an independent contractor as of February 13, 2008, and regards the validity of the latter's registration as such until February 14, 2011, well within the period relevant to this appeal. x x x.\n\nx x x x\n\nPer documentary evidence attached by CBMI, the company's total assets at the time of filing of the respondents' complaint before the NLRC in 2010 amounted to Php84,351,349.00. Based on its attached Audited Financial Statements for the years 2008 and 2009, its total assets, which consists of cash, receivables, and property and equipment, amounted to Php79,203,902.00 and Php76,189,554.00, respectively.\n\nLikewise from the records, as of December 2010, CBMI has an authorized capital stock of 1,000,000.00 shares, half of which or 500,000.00 have been subscribed. Its retained earnings for the years 2009 and 2010 consists of Php6,433,525.00 and Php10,988,890.00, respectively. Incidentally, for the years 2005 to 2007 and 2012, CBMI's paid-up capital amounted to Php3,500,000.00, which is even beyond by the standard set by the DOLE D.O. No. 18-A, series of 2011, of what constitutes \"substantial capital.\"\n\nClearly, CBMI has substantial capital to maintain its manpower business. From the evidence adduced by CBMI, it is also clear that it runs a business independent from the PPI. Based on its registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), CBMI has been in existence since 1967; and has since provided a variety of services to entities in various fields, such as banking, hospitals, and even government institutions. CBMI counts among its clients, De La Salle University (DLSU), Philippine National Bank (PNB), Smart Communications, Inc., SM Supermalls, and the United States (US) Embassy. In the case of the US Embassy for instance, CBMI has been a service contractor for seven years.\n\nAbove all, CBMI maintains the \"right of control\" over the respondents. x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nWithout necessarily touching on the respondents' status prior to their employment with CBMI, in the instant controversy, [CBMI's] control over the respondents is manifested by the fact that they wield and exercise the following powers over them: \"selection and engagement, payment of wages, dismissal, and control over the employees' conduct.\"\n\nx x x x\n\nAll these, without doubt indicate that CBMI possesses the power of control over the respondents; which in turn supports the conclusion that CBMI carries a business independent of PPI.[60]\nSimilarly, the Court in Cayetano held the following: (1) CBMI has complied with all the requirements of a legitimate job contractor, given the certificates of registration issued to it by the Department of Labor and Employment;[61] (2) CBMI has substantial capital to properly carry out its obligations with petitioner, and to sufficiently cover its own operational expenses;[62] (3) CBMI retained control over respondents, as shown by the deployment of at least one CBMI supervisor in each petitioner branch to regularly oversee, monitor, and supervise the employees' attendance and performance;[63] (4) CBMI subjected therein respondents to disciplinary sanctions for violations of company rules and regulations as shown by the various offense notices and memoranda issued to them;[64] (5) respondents applied for work with CBMI and were consequently selected and hired by the latter;[65] and (6) during the course of their employment, CBMI paid their wages and remitted\/paid their SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG contributions.[66]\n\nWith the foregoing findings, the Court in Cayetano similarly concluded that CBMI is a legitimate job contractor, and thus, the employer of therein respondents.\n\nThe allegation that herein respondents were not the same employees involved in Asprec and Cayetano does not negate the application of stare decisis in the case.[67] It suffices that respondents are similarly situated with the employees in Asprec and Cayetano,[68] and that the facts and issues at bar are similar to those obtaining in the case laws.[69]\n\nIn the case, the labor tribunals held that respondents failed to establish the following: (1) that petitioner exercised control and supervision over the means and methods of their work;[70] and (2) that petitioner owned the motorcycles which respondents used in the performance of their duties.[71]\n\nIn addition, the labor tribunals were one in holding the following: (1) that it was CBMI which exercised all the aspects of being an employer over respondents through its Supervisor Ortañez;[72] and (2) that CBMI was a legitimate job contractor, and consequently, the employer of respondents. Being consistent with the case laws, such findings of the labor tribunals were indubitably supported by substantial evidence. Thus, the CA erred in finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC.\n\nAt any rate, the Court adheres to the principle of stare decisis and stands by the decision in Asprec and Cayetano.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.

{"id":5,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 217866, June 20, 2022 ]\nSOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, PETITIONER, VS. VIOLETA A. SIMACAS, RESPONDENT.\n\nDECISION\nLEONEN, SAJ.:\n\nSettled is the rule that for a non-occupational disease to be compensable, substantial evidence must be presented to prove that the risk of contracting the illness was aggravated by the employee's working conditions. It suffices that the evidence presented establish a reasonable work connection. It is not necessary that a direct causal relation be proven.[1]\n\nThis Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari,[2] challenging the Court of Appeals Decision[3] and Resolution[4] which reversed the Employees Compensation Commission's denial[5] of Violeta A. Simacas' (Violeta) claim for death benefits under Presidential Decree No. 626, as amended. The assailed resolution denied petitioner Social Security System's motion for reconsideration.\n\nIrnido L. Simacas (Irnido) worked as a Fabrication Helper at Fieldstar Manufacturing Corporation (Fieldstar) from April 1995 until February 2010 where he assisted the welder and machinist in cutting steel materials.[6]\n\nTwo years before retiring, Irnido complained of back pains and incessant coughing. He availed the services of Fieldstar's health care provider, Intellicare, which cleared him for work after assessment. However, Irnido's symptoms worsened until he was no longer able to perform his job. In February 2010, he was retired from work by Fieldstar.[7]\n\nOn February 20, 2010, Irnido was hospitalized due to back pains, cough, dysuria or painful urination, night sweating, and fever. He was diagnosed \"with Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BHP) T\/C (to consider) Prostatic Cancer and Pneumonia vs. Pulmonary Tuberculosis[.]\"[8] At the time he was hospitalized, he had already been taking medication for Pulmonary Tuberculosis for a month and had also been diagnosed with Hepatitis A.[9]\n\nMonths later, Irnido was again admitted to the hospital due to severe chest and back pains as well as difficulty in breathing.[10]\n\nOn July 13, 2010, Irnido died at the Philippine Orthopedic Center. His death certificate[11] stated that the immediate cause of his death was Cardiopulmonary Arrest probably secondary to Metastatic Prostatic Adenocarcinoma.[12]\n\nVioleta, Irnido's surviving spouse, filed a claim for employees' compensation benefits which was denied by the Social Security System Sta. Maria Branch[13] on the ground that the cause of Irnido's death was a non-occupational disease.[14]\n\nAfter further evaluation,[15] the Social Security System's Medical Operations Department also denied Violeta's claim ruling that prostatic adenocarcinoma or prostate cancer was not considered an occupational disease and had no causal relationship with Irnido's job as a fabrication helper.[16]\n\nOn May 21, 2012, the Medical Operations Department elevated the case to the Employees Compensation Commission.[17]\n\nIn its July 27, 2012 decision, the Commission affirmed the denial of Violeta's claim. It ruled that since prostate cancer is a non-occupational disease, Violeta was required to prove that Irnido's work increased the risk of him contracting prostate cancer. It noted that considering the nature of Irnido's work and the etiology of prostate cancer, his work could not have contributed to the development of the disease. It further held that no evidence was presented by Violeta to establish a causal relation between Irnido's work and the illness which caused his death.[18]\n\nAggrieved, Violeta appealed before the Court of Appeals.[19]\n\nIn its assailed Decision, the Court of Appeals reversed the Commission's decision and ordered the Social Security System to pay Violeta's claim for death benefits.[20] It stressed that Presidential Decree No. 626 is a social legislation designed to protect workers from loss of income by reason of the hazards of disability and illness. It underscored that for this purpose to be realized, the implementing authorities must adopt a liberal attitude in deciding compensability claims.[21]\n\nIt applied Government Service Insurance System v. Court of Appeals,[22]and held that it was impossible for Violeta to present evidence of causal relation since the specific cause for prostate cancer is medically unknown. It decreed that given the present state of scientific knowledge, \"the obligation to present such impossible evidence. . . must, therefore, be deemed void.\"[23]\n\nSocial Security System moved for reconsideration but it was denied on April 8, 2015.[24]\n\nDissatisfied, Social Security System filed a Petition for Review before this Court.\n\nPetitioner argues that since prostate cancer is not considered an occupational disease, respondent is obligated to prove that Irnido's work increased the risk of him contracting the disease.[25] It maintains that the absence of medical information demonstrating that Irnido's working conditions caused his prostate cancer renders respondent's claim of work connection untenable.[26]\n\nIn her Comment,[27] respondent contends that the Court of Appeals' factual findings bind this Court unless the existence of the accepted exceptions is established.[28]\n\nShe further maintains that claims under Presidential Decree No. 626 should be liberally resolved in favor of labor to realize its purpose of being a social legislation.[29]\n\nAdditionally, she asserts that while prostate cancer is not an occupational disease, the circumstances surrounding Irnido's death shows that his working conditions aggravated the risk of him contracting the disease. She avers that Irnido's work \"included strenuous lifting of heavy steel and metal materials and equipment,\" buying of parts and supplies, and performing welding jobs in case of the welder's unavailability. Moreover, Irnido's work area was cramped, crowded, and had little ventilation.[30]\n\nFinally, she cites this Court's ruling in GSIS and maintains that the insufficiency of scientific knowledge regarding prostate cancer renders it impossible for her to comply with the law's evidentiary requirement.[31]\n\nIn its Reply,[32] petitioner reiterates its contention that respondent failed to adduce substantial evidence to prove that there is causal relation between Irnido's work and illness. It further claims that respondent cannot rely on the increased risk theory considering that there is not enough basis to infer that Irnido's illness is work-related.[33]\n\nOn November 12, 2018, both parties were required to submit their Memoranda.\n\nIn its Memorandum,[34] petitioner restates its assertions that respondent is not entitled to death benefits[35] since she failed to prove that the risk of contracting the disease was increased by Irnido's working conditions.[36]\n\nMeanwhile, respondent filed a Manifestation[37] indicating that she will no longer file a memorandum and adopting all arguments in her Comment.\n\nFor this Court's resolution are the following issues;\n\nFirst, whether or not factual questions may be resolved in this Petition; and\n\nSecond, whether or not respondent, Violeta A. Simacas, spouse of deceased Irnido L. Simacas, is entitled to death benefit under Presidential Decree No. 626, as amended.\n\nThe Petition is unmeritorious.\n\nI\n\nIt is an oft-repeated principle that only questions of law should be raised in a petition for review. Factual findings of the Court of Appeals are deemed binding and conclusive upon this Court especially when supported by substantial evidence.[38] Not being a trier of facts, this Court is not obligated \"to examine and determine the weight of the evidence supporting the assailed decision.\"[39]\n\nNonetheless, the rule is not absolute and admits of exceptions. Medina v. Asistio, Jr.[40] laid down the exceptions to this rule:\n(1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) The finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record.[41] (Citations omitted)\nRecords show that the Court of Appeals' factual findings differ from those of petitioner and the Employees Compensation Commission. Due to these conflicting findings and conclusion, this Court, in resolving the case, may reevaluate the evidence presented by the parties.\n\nII\n\nThe Labor Code defines sickness as \"any illness definitely accepted as an occupational disease listed by the Commission, or any illness caused by employment subject to proof that the risk of contracting the same is increased by working conditions.\"[42]\n\nTo be compensable, the Implementing Rules of Presidential Decree No. 626 states that the sickness and the resulting death \"must be the result of an occupational disease listed under Annex 'A' of these Rules[.]\" If the illness is a non-Occupational disease, \"proof must be shown that the risk of contracting the disease is increased by the working conditions.\"[43]\n\nIt is undisputed that the sickness which caused Irnido's death is not a listed occupational disease. Thus, it is incumbent upon respondent to demonstrate that the risk of contracting prostate cancer was increased by Irnido's working conditions.\n\nIn establishing compensability, the claimant need only present substantial proof that the nature of the deceased's work or working conditions increased the risk of them contracting prostate cancer. The degree of proof necessary was discussed in Sarmiento v. Employees' Compensation Commission:[44]\nStrict rules of evidence are not applicable in claims for compensation. There are no stringent criteria to follow. The degree of proof required under P.D. 626, is merely substantial evidence, which means, \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\". The claimant must show, at least, by substantial evidence that the development of the disease is brought largely by the conditions present in the nature of the job. What the law requires is a reasonable work-connection and not a direct causal relation. It is enough that the hypothesis on which the workmen's claim is based is probable. Medical opinion to the contrary can be disregarded especially where there is some basis in the facts for inferring a work-connection. Probability not certainty is the touchstone.[45] (Citations omitted)\nA review of the records reveals that respondent proved that Irnido's working conditions increased the risk of him contracting prostate cancer.\n\nProstate cancer is characterized as a condition where \"certain cells in the prostate become abnormal, multiply without control or order, and form a tumor.\"[46] While it is one of the leading causes of death among men,[47] not much is known about the illness' etiology or cause.[48]\n\nThe established risk factors for prostate cancer \"are advanced age, ethnicity, genetic factors and family history[.]\"[49] However, several studies have suggested that work-related exposures to certain substances, such as chromium, have the potential of affecting the risk of getting prostate cancer.[50] A recent study \"revealed a small but significant increase in prostate cancer risk for chromium exposure[.]\"[51]\n\nIn this case, it is undisputed that the deceased's work included assisting the welder and machinist in cutting steel materials. It is said that \"[w]orkers engaged in the manufacturing or handling stainless steel are exposed to chromium in varying degrees.\"[52] Thus, it is not unlikely that Irnido's work increased the risk of him contracting the disease. This probability suffices to warrant the grant of the claimed benefits.\n\nIt must be stressed that while Presidential Decree No. 626 has not incorporated \"the presumption of compensability and the theory of aggravation prevalent under the 'Workmen's Compensation Act[,]\"[53] it continues to be \"an employees' compensation law or a social legislation\"[54]which should be liberally construed in favor of labor.\n\nThis Court's reiterates its statement in Obra v. Social Security System:[55]\nAs a final note, we find it necessary to reiterate that P.D. No. 626, as amended, is a social legislation whose primordial purpose is to provide meaningful protection to the working class against the hazards of disability, illness and other contingencies resulting in the loss of income. Thus, as the official agents charged by law to implement social justice guaranteed by the Constitution, the ECC and the SSS should adopt a liberal attitude in favor of the employee in deciding claims for compensability especially where there is some basis in the facts for inferring a work connection with the illness or injury, as the case may be. It is only this kind of interpretation that can give meaning and substance to the compassionate spirit of the law as embodied in Article 4 of the New Labor Code which states that all doubts in the implementation and interpretation of the provisions of the Labor Code including its implementing rules and regulations should be resolved in favor of labor.[56] (Citation omitted)\nWHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' August 29, 2014 Decision and April 8, 2015 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 126890 are hereby affirmed.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nLazaro-Javier, M. Lopez, J.

LUCIA REALTY AND DEVELOPMENT, INC., RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nGAERLAN, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Rule 45 petition for review against the August 28, 2009 Decision[1] and April 19, 2010 Resolution[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 90968, which reversed the January 31, 2008 Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 77, in Civil Case No. Q-01-45599, which in turn is a suit for easement of right of way.\n\nPetitioners Marcial and Elizabeth Vargas (the Spouses) own a 10,000 square-meter parcel of land located in Barangay Batasan Hills, Quezon City (the Outside Lot).[4] In 2000, the Spouses bought another 300-square-meter parcel of land (the VRC Lot) in a private residential subdivision known as Vista Real Classica[5] (VRC), which is adjacent to their Outside Lot.[6]\n\nThrough a letter dated October 5, 2001, the Spouses demanded from the developer of VRC, Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc. (SLR),[7] a right of way from the Outside Lot through their VRC Lot, into VRC's streets, and into a public road (Commonwealth Avenue).[8]\n\nOn November 19, 2001, the Spouses filed a complaint before the Quezon City RTC, praying for the establishment of a right of way as stated in the aforementioned letter.[9] In its Answer, SLR denied receiving the Spouses' demand letter and claimed that it never had any discussion or correspondence with the Spouses regarding the right of way issue.[10] At any rate, SLR argued that a right of way for the Outside Lot cannot be constituted through VRC's streets, for the following reasons: 1) SLR is bound to enclose VRC with a perimeter fence; 2) the Deed of Restrictions for the VRC Lot expressly prohibits the use of the lot as an access to any adjacent lot outside the subdivision; 3) there is no showing that VRC is the main cause of the Outside Lot's isolation from the nearest public road; 4) the grant of right of way requires an alteration of the already-approved subdivision and development plans for VRC; and 5) the claimed right of way is not convenient, practicable, and feasible, as it would require the Spouses to obtain the consent of the VRC homeowners' association and of other VRC lot owners.[11]\n\nDuring the trial, the parties called three witnesses: petitioner Marcial Vargas (Marcial), Victor Juego, Jr. (Juego), and Fredeswinda Cruz (Cruz).\n\nThe Spouses presented Marcial as their sole witness. He reiterated the allegations in their complaint. He testified that the Outside Lot and the VRC Lot are adjacent to each other.[12] He expressly stated that the nearest highway to the Outside Lot is Commonwealth Avenue, and that the route between those points is through Barcelona Street, all the way to Baltimore Street, until Vista Real Avenue (all located within VRC), towards Commonwealth Avenue.[13] He also admitted that his wife Elizabeth bought the VRC Lot for the purpose of obtaining a right of way for their Outside Lot.[14] He also presented the certificates of title, deeds of sale, tax declarations, and sketch plans for the two lots.[15] When cross-examined on the Deed of Restrictions appearing in the certificate of title of the VRC Lot, Marcial said that he \"cannot understand this fully well.\"[16]\n\nTwo SLR employees testified on the company's behalf. Juego, a civil engineer, was tasked, among others, to issue permits for the construction of houses located within SLR's subdivisions, in part, to ensure that such constructions are compliant with the Deed of Restrictions applicable to each subdivision.[17] He admitted that when the Spouses' request was referred to him, he refused to make a recommendation because his job is limited to issuing construction permits.[18] However, he pointed out that the Spouses ought to have known about the prohibition on using SLR subdivision lots as right of way access points because this is indicated on the TCT of the VRC Lot.[19] The second employee, Cruz, was the cashier\/sales coordinator[20] who handled the sale and transfer transactions of the lots in VRC.[21] She testified that the Spouses bought the VRC Lot from a secondary buyer who bought the same from the persons who bought the lot directly from SLR.[22] On cross-examination, she admitted that the Deed of Restrictions is only signed by the first buyers who buy new subdivision lots directly from SLR;[23] however, she testified that such agreement is physically transferred to any subsequent buyer.[24]\n\nThe Spouses formally offered the following evidence: the transfer certificates of title (TCTs), bracketed sketch plans, tax declarations, and real property tax receipts of the VRC and Outside Lots; a copy of the October 5, 2001 demand letter; and the Deed of Sale for the VRC Lot.[25] In turn, SLR offered the following evidence: sales plan of VRC; the VRC Deed of Restrictions; the TCT for the VRC Lot; the original contract to sell between SLR and the first buyer of the VRC Lot; and the deeds of Transfer of Rights from the original buyer of the VRC Lot to the second buyer thereof, and from the second buyer to petitioner Elizabeth Vargas.[26]\n\nAfter trial, the RTC rendered its decision granting the right of way as demanded by the Spouses, subject to the payment of indemnity; and ordering SLR to pay attorney's fees and litigation expenses.[27] It found that the Outside Lot was indeed surrounded by other immovables and its only outlet to a public highway is through VRC, and these facts are not even disputed by SLR.[28] Rejecting as fallacious SLR's defense that the grant of right of way to the Outside Lot through VRC amounts to an alteration of the subdivision plan prohibited under Presidential Decree No. 957,[29] the RTC held that the grant of right of way merely involves SLR, allowing the Spouses to access their Outside Lot through VRC's streets; and such mere act of allowing passage does not involve any alteration of VRC's subdivision plan.[30] Furthermore, the easement of right of way is a statutory limitation on property, and the right of the dominant estate to such right of way cannot be taken away by a subdivision plan, for statutory provisions are deemed written into the contracts between SLR and the buyers of its subdivision lots.[31]\n\nOn appeal by SLR, the CA reversed the RTC decision and dismissed the Spouses' complaint. Proceeding from the principle that easements are burdens on property which must be imposed with the strictest caution,[32] the appellate court held that the Spouses failed to prove the existence of the requisites for the establishment of a compulsory right of way under the Civil Code. First, the Spouses failed to substantiate their allegation that the route through VRC is the Outside Lot's only adequate outlet to a public highway.[33] The existence of other outlets is not clear from the record.[34] Second, the Spouses failed to prove that they offered to indemnify SLR for the claimed right of way.[35] Finally, the Spouses failed to prove that their proposed route for the claimed right of way is the least prejudicial to VRC.[36] The CA noted that the Spouses' failure to adduce proof of the condition of the other lots surrounding the Outside Lot made it impossible to ascertain: 1) the shortest route to the nearest public road, and 2) which lot will be least prejudiced by the claimed easement.[37]\n\nWith their motion for reconsideration having been denied, the Spouses now raise the matter before the Supreme Court. In their pleadings,[38] the Spouses reiterate the findings and conclusions of the trial court and fault the CA for reversing the same.[39] They emphasize that SLR never disputed or disproved their allegations regarding the isolation of the Outside Lot from the public road network and the feasibility of the right of way through VRC's streets.[40] The Spouses also blame SLR for the non-tender of indemnity, as the latter never responded to their initial written demand.[41] In its comment, SLR echoes the CA in arguing that the Spouses' evidence failed to establish compliance with the legal requisites for a compulsory easement of right of way. Particularly, the sketch plan of the Outside Lot shows that it is also bounded by three other lots;[42] but the Spouses did not adduce any evidence on the access, or lack thereof, of these lots to a public road. Without such proof, the Spouses cannot claim that the route through VRC is the shortest, least inexpensive, and least prejudicial outlet to a public highway.[43]\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court is now asked to determine whether the Spouses are entitled to a right of way from their Outside Lot through VRC.\n\n\"An easement or servitude is an encumbrance imposed upon an immovable for the benefit of another immovable belonging to a different owner.\"[44] In turn, a right of way easement is one such encumbrance which is imposed for the benefit of another immovable \"which is surrounded by other immovables pertaining to other persons and without adequate outlet to a public highway\".[45] As laid down in Articles 649 and 650 of the Civil Code and synthesized by jurisprudence, the requisites for the establishment of a right of way easement are:\n1. The immovable benefiting from the right of way (referred to by law as the dominant estate) is surrounded by other immovables and has no adequate outlet to a public highway;\n\n2. The owner, user, or holder of the dominant estate must pay proper indemnity to the owner of the immovable on which the easement is being imposed;\n\n3. The isolation of the dominant estate is not the result of its owner, user, or holder's own acts; and\n\n4. The claimed right of way must be at the point least prejudicial to the immovable on which the easement is being imposed (referred to by law as the servient estate); and insofar as consistent with this rule, where the distance of the dominant estate to a public highway may be the shortest.[46]\nIn a proceeding for the compulsory imposition of a right of way easement, the burden of proving compliance with the foregoing requisites lies with the owner, holder, or user of the dominant estate.[47] Consequently, the Spouses cannot rely solely on SLR's failure to submit rebuttal evidence. It is the duty of the Spouses, as the party claiming the easement of right of way, to establish compliance with the requisites set forth by law for the imposition thereof; and we find that they failed to do so.\n\nAnent the first requisite, although the Spouses were able to prove that the Outside Lot is indeed surrounded by other immovables, they failed to prove that it has no adequate outlet to a public highway. On this note, the prevailing rule is that the courts will compel the establishment of a right of way only when absolutely necessary. If an isolated lot may be given access to a public road without imposing an easement, courts will not grant the easement.[48] Thus, we have consistently dismissed right of way claims upon proof of the existence of another adequate outlet from the dominant estate to a main road.[49] In Costabella Corp. v. Court of Appeals,[50] we held that \"when there is already an existing adequate outlet from the dominant estate to a public highway, even if the said outlet, for one reason or another, be inconvenient, the need to open up another servitude is entirely unjustified\".[51] In Reyes v. Valentin,[52] we dismissed the claim for right of way upon a finding that the lot in question can be connected to the public road network by building a bridge over an irrigation canal which separated the lot from the adjacent road; and in Dichoso, Jr. v. Marcos,[53] we held that:\nAdmittedly, petitioners had been granted a right of way through the other adjacent lot owned by the Spouses Arce. In fact, other lot owners use the said outlet in going to and coming from the public highway. Clearly, there is an existing outlet to and from the public road.\n\nHowever, petitioners claim that the outlet is longer and circuitous, and they have to pass through other lots owned by different owners before they could get to the highway. We find petitioners' concept of what is \"adequate outlet\" a complete disregard of the well-entrenched doctrine that in order to justify the imposition of an easement of right of way, there must be real, not fictitious or artificial, necessity for it. Mere convenience for the dominant estate is not what is required by law as the basis of setting up a compulsory easement.[54]\nTo prove the absence of an adequate outlet to a public highway, jurisprudence requires the claimant to allege and prove the accessibility circumstances of all the immovables surrounding the isolated lot. In Sps. Mejorada v. Vertudazo,[55] we held that the first requisite had been met because the claimant was able to prove that \"there is no other road which respondents could use leading to [the nearest public road] except the passageway on petitioners' property\";[56] while in Quimen v. CA,[57] the trial court found that the dominant estate was \"totally isolated from the public highway\".[58] In Calimoso v. Roullo,[59] the evidence submitted by the parties enabled the courts to discern three access options for the dominant estate, thus facilitating the determination of the propriety of the claimed right of way:\nThat the respondent's lot is surrounded by several estates and has no access to a public road are undisputed. The only question before this Court is whether the right-of-way passing through the petitioners' lot satisfies the fourth requirement of being established at the point least prejudicial to the servient estate.\n\nThree options were then available to the respondent for the demanded right­-of-way: the first option is to traverse directly through the petitioners' property, which route has an approximate distance of fourteen (14) meters from the respondent's lot to the Fajardo Subdivision Road; the second option is to pass through two vacant lots (Lots 1461-B-1 and 1461-B-2) located on the southwest of the respondent's lot, which route has an approximate distance of forty-three (43) meters to another public highway, the Diversion Road; and the third option is to construct a concrete bridge over Sipac Creek and ask for a right-of-way on the property of a certain Mr. Basa in order to reach the Fajardo Subdivision Road.[60]\nIn Naga Centrum, Inc. v. Sps. Orzales,[61] we sustained the trial court's grant of a right of way in favor of respondents, who were able to submit a detailed history of the surroundings of their isolated lot, as follows:\nThe evidence shows that when respondents bought their property in 1965, they passed through the open spaces within Estela and Dela Cruz's lots to get from their lot to the public road, Valentin Street. When Rizal Street was created as a passageway to and from Valentin Street by informal settlers who occupied portions of the subject 1.9-hectare property, which was then owned by Felix Ledda, respondents began using the same as well, after having personal disagreements with Estela and Dela Cruz. Petitioner acquired the property from the Leddas only on July 7, 1980. In 2003, petitioner evicted the informal settlers and closed Rizal Street, except to respondents, who were allowed to use the same as access to and from Valentin Street, although on a limited schedule, or from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily. Burdened by this imposition, respondents made a formal demand to acquire a portion of petitioner's property to serve as access to Valentin Street, which petitioner rejected. Respondents then instituted Civil Case No. 2004-0036.[62]\nIn Lee v. Spouses Carreon,[63] we also sustained the grant of a right of way, upon the CA's finding that:\nWhat defendant-appellant insists is that plaintiffs-appellees can use another outlet leading to the nearest road by traversing several small lots and thereafter use the northern portion of his property which he is willing to be the subject of a right of way. The trial court found that plaintiffs-appellees managed to reach the nearest road through any passage available, passing through several lots as they were unobstructed by any structure of fence. However, as correctly ruled by the court a quo, this is not the adequate outlet referred to by law. Plaintiffs-appellees have every right in accordance with law to formally demand for an adequate outlet sufficient for their needs. Moreover, the alternative route referred to by defendant-appellant appears to be merely a proposed outlet, not yet in existence.[64]\nIn Sps. Sta. Maria v. CA,[65] the detailed accessibility circumstances of the surrounding estates, as appearing in the records, enabled us to uphold the grant of a right of way:\nUnder the second and fourth assigned errors, the petitioners try to convince us that there are two other existing passage ways over the property of Cruz and over that of Jacinto, as well as a \"daang tao,\" for private respondents' use. Our examination of the records yields otherwise. Said lots of Cruz and Jacinto do not have existing passage ways for the private respondents to use. Moreover, the Ocular Inspection Report reveals that the suggested alternative ways through Cruz's or Jacinto's properties are longer and \"circuitous\" than that through petitioners' property. This is also clear from the Sketch Plan submitted by the private respondents wherein it is readily seen that the lots of Cruz and Jacinto are only adjacent to that of private respondents unlike that of petitioners which is directly in front of private respondents' property in relation to the public highway.[66]\nFinally, in Almendras v. CA[67] (Almendras), which involved a claim for right of way by the owner of a subdivided lot which became isolated from the public road network by virtue of the subdivision, we remanded the case for further proceedings on the basis of the detailed accessibility circumstances of the surrounding lots, which served as the Court's basis for reinstating the case and the remand thereof:\nIn the case at bar, the trial court ruled that the easement should be constituted through the land of private respondents on the eastern side because it would be the shortest way to the provincial road, being only 17.45 meters long, compared to 149.22 meters if the easement was constituted on the Opone and Tudtud roads on the western and southern sides of petitioner's land.\n\nOn the other hand, as already pointed out, the Court of Appeals, in pointing to the longer way, considered the fact that this was already existing and does not preclude its use by other parties than the individual owners of Lot 1-A to Lot 1-G and the owners of the land on which the connecting Tudtud road is found.\n\nThe way may be longer and not the most direct way to the provincial road, but if the establishment of the easement in favor of petitioner on this road will cause the least prejudice, then the easement should be constituted there. This seems to be reasoning of the Court of Appeals. However, this can only be determined if the several lot owners (i.e., the Opones and their buyers and those of Bienvenido Tudtud) are before the court, for the determination of the point least prejudicial to the owners of servient estates (if there are two or more possible sites for an easement) requires a comparative evaluation of the physical conditions of the estates. It is not possible to determine whether the estates which would be least prejudiced by the easement would be those of the owners of the Opone and Tudtud properties because they have not been heard. Although evidence concerning the condition of their estates has been presented by private respondents, it is impossible to determine with certainty which estate would be least prejudiced by the establishment of an easement for petitioner until these parties have been heard. Any decision holding them liable to bear the easement would not be binding on them since they are not parties to this action.[68]\nIn the case at bar, although the Spouses repeatedly claim that the route through VRC is the only access to the Outside Lot, this allegation is not supported by evidence which precludes the existence of \"other roads which they could traverse or x x x other adequate outlets which may lead to other roads.\"[69] Stated differently, the Spouses' evidence does not prove that, in the Court's words, \"there is no other road which they could use\" other than the streets within VRC, or that the Outside Lot was \"totally isolated from the public highway\". The sketch plans submitted by the Spouses clearly show that the Outside Lot is a rectangular parcel bounded on one side by VRC, and on the other three sides, by three other lots, denominated in the plans as Lot 10, PCS-2587, Lot 9, PCS-2587, and Lot 14, PCS-2587.[70] Following the aforequoted decisions of the Court, the Spouses should have alleged and proved the physical and geographical circumstances of these three adjacent lots, so that the courts may determine if these lots are adequate outlets for the Outside Lot. However, the sketch plans submitted by the Spouses focus solely on mapping their proposed route through VRC Lot, without providing the same level of mapping detail for Lots 9, 10, and 14 of PCS-2587. The Spouses' pleadings do not explain the absolute dearth of evidence on the accessibility circumstances of said lots. Instead, they simply harp on SLR's failure to adduce rebuttal evidence, and devote their efforts solely to arguing for their proposed right of way through VRC, which is not surprising, since, by their own admission, they bought the VRC Lot for the sole purpose of obtaining a right of way for their adjacent Outside Lot.[71]\n\nThe Spouses' failure to submit any evidence on the physical and geographical condition of the three other lots surrounding the Outside Lot also prevented them from establishing compliance with the fourth requisite. Verily, the trial court could not have ruled on the Spouses' allegation that the streets inside VRC are the shortest route and only available access from the Outside Lot to Commonwealth Avenue, precisely because there is no data on the accessibility of the three other lots with which the trial court could compare and contrast the adequacy of the proposed route through VRC. In the absence of such data, it is not even possible to rule on the specific objections raised by SLR to the use of its VRC streets, for, in the words of Almendras, the \"determination of the point least prejudicial to the owners of servient estates (if there are two or more possible sites for an easement) requires a comparative evaluation of the physical conditions of the estates.\"[72] Again, we reiterate that the Spouses' failure to submit evidence on the condition of the three other lots surrounding the Outside Lot made such comparative evaluation impossible.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Court DENIES the present petition and AFFIRMS the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

SPOUSES FRANK RHEDEY AND JOCELYN RHEDEY, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\nINTING, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated July 26, 2019 and the Resolution[3] dated July 6, 2020 of the Court of Appeals (CA), Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. CV No. 04759-MIN. The assailed CA Decision denied the appeal filed by Gaisano Superstore, Inc. (Valencia City Branch) (petitioner); and affirmed the Decision[4] dated December 9, 2016 and the Order dated July 18, 2017[5] of Branch 9, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Malaybalay City, Bukidnon in Civil Case No. 4189-11 that ordered petitioner to pay Spouses Frank Rhedey and Jocelyn Rhedey (respondents) P50,000.00 as temperate damages and P10,000.00 as actual damages.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nRespondents bought from petlt10ner several Cadbury chocolate bars in September 2007. When respondents opened the chocolate bars, they discovered that these were infested with maggots, maggot eggs, and cobwebs. They informed Cadbury Adams Philippines, Inc. (Cadbury) of the incident, and the latter offered to pay respondents the amount of P7,000.00 as compensation.[6]\n\nA similar incident happened on January 29, 2008 when respondents once again bought Cadbury chocolate bars from petitioner as gifts for Frank Rhedey's (Frank) brother-in-law. All eight chocolate bars they purchased were likewise found to have been infested with live maggots, maggot eggs, and cobwebs. Respondents communicated with Cadbury, which assured them that they will conduct an investigation on the matter.[7]\n\nThere being no positive result on the investigation allegedly conducted by Cadbury, respondents filed a complaint before the Department of Health (DOH), Region 10, Carmen, Cagayan de Oro City. The DOH conducted an investigation by purchasing a Cadbury chocolate bar from petitioner and subjecting it to laboratory examination. After testing and analysis, the result showed that the chocolate was no longer fit for consumption. Despite this finding, however, the complaint was dismissed by the DOH on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over respondents' claim for damages amounting to P10,000,000.00.[8]\n\nRespondents still tried to demand compensation from Cadbury and petitioner as a last-ditch effort but to no avail. This prompted respondents to file a case in the RTC against Cadbury and petitioner for damages for their alleged malicious and fraudulent acts of selling infested products and refusing to give compensation.[9]\n\nIn its Answer, petitioner asserted that respondents have no cause of action against it: first, because the complaint is already barred by laches and prescription as the supposed purchase of the chocolates took place almost four (4) years before the filing of the complaint; and second, because there was no proof of purchase of the chocolate bars attached to the complaint.[10]\n\nMeanwhile, because summons was left unserved, the RTC ordered the archiving of the case with respect to Cadbury for failure of the RTC to acquire jurisdiction over it.[11]\n\nThe Ruling of the RTC\n\nOn December 9, 2016, the RTC rendered a Decision[12] in favor of respondents and held:\nALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERED, this Court renders a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. By more than preponderance of evidence plaintiff Spouses Rhedey proved that they are entitled to damages. Defendant Gaisano is adjudged liable and ordered to pay the spouses the following sum[s]:\n1. P50,000.00 as temperate damages; and\n2. P10,000.00 as actual damages.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.[13]\nThe RTC found that petitioner is liable for damages for selling contaminated food products under Republic Act No. (RA) 7394, otherwise known as The Consumer Act of the Philippines.[14] However, it ruled that while respondents proved that they suffered pecuniary loss, the amount thereof cannot be proven with certainty, thereby entitling them to temperate damages amounting to P50,000.00.[15]\n\nIn addition, the RTC awarded actual damages in favor of respondents in the amount of P10,000.00 representing litigation expenses.[16]\n\nPetitioner sought reconsideration, but the RTC denied it in an Order dated July 18, 2017.[17] Petitioner thus appealed to the CA.\n\nThe Ruling of the CA\n\nIn its Decision[18] dated July 26, 2019, the CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC. The CA found no cogent reason to depart from the factual findings of the RTC in that: (1) a receipt, as a proof of purchase, is not exclusive or conclusive evidence, and in its absence, the fact of purchase may be established by other evidence of the circumstances under which it was given[19] such as the positive testimony of Frank;[20] and (2) petitioner was negligent in selling spoiled or defective Cadbury chocolates to respondents under Articles 97 and 98 of RA 7394.[21]\n\nThe CA explained that petitioner, being an establishment engaged in the business of selling goods such as chocolates, has the duty to exercise due care and diligence in maintaining a safe environment and preventing any danger from contaminating the perishable goods it sells. The CA ruled that petitioner's failure to exercise the degree of care and diligence required of it as a seller renders it liable to respondents.[22]\n\nPetitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration,[23] but the CA denied it in the assailed Resolution[24] dated July 6, 2020.\n\nHence, the petition before the Court.\n\nThe Issue\n\nThe sole issue raised in the petition is whether petitioner is liable for damages despite respondents' failure to present the receipts of the purchase of the Cadbury chocolates.\n\nPetitioner asserts that both the RTC and the CA erred when they gave credence to the allegation of respondents that the Cadbury chocolate bars were purchased at its store despite the fact that respondents failed to present in evidence any official receipt that will prove it. Petitioner insists that the alleged purchase by respondents of the chocolate bars at the Gaisano store must be proven first based on the rule that he or she who alleges must prove his or her allegation.[25]\n\nIn their Comment,[26] respondents point out that their testimony during the trial must be considered as a whole because the fact of purchase was clearly testified to with precise details and certainty by Frank himself. Moreover, one of the witnesses of petitioner even testified that she was ordered by their department head to pull out the Cadbury chocolate bars from the store display after respondents' first complaint on September 26, 2007.[27] Thus, respondents maintain that the RTC and CA did not err when they adjudged petitioner liable for damages.[28]\n\nIn its Rejoinder,[29] petitioner argues that RA 7394 is not applicable in the case unless respondents can show the official receipt that would prove that the maggot-infested chocolates were purchased from its store.[30]\n\nThe Courts Ruling\n\nThe petition is without merit. The CA did not commit any reversible error that would merit the Court's exercise of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction.\n\nBefore proceeding to the merits of the case, the Court deems it necessary to emphasize that a petition for review under Rule 45 is limited only to questions of law.[31] The rule, however, is not without exceptions. In Medina v. Mayor Asistio, Jr.,[32] it was held that findings of fact by the CA may be passed upon and reviewed by the Court in the following instances: (1) when the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd, or impossible; (3) where there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) when the CA, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) when the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioners' main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) when the finding of fact of the CA is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record.[33]\n\nAlthough jurisprudence has provided several exceptions to the rule, the exceptions must be alleged, substantiated, and proved by the parties, so that the Court may evaluate and review the facts of the case.[34] Here, petitioner merely alleges that the CA erred in sustaining the RTC which ruled in favor of respondents despite their failure to present the receipts of the chocolate bars that they purchased. In other words, petitioner is assailing the findings of fact and appreciation of evidence by the RTC as affirmed by the CA. There is no question of law raised in the petition and there is likewise no indication that a review of the facts of the case is warranted under the circumstances that would justify the Court's exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.\n\nAt any rate, the award of damages to respondents is anchored in Article 2176 of the Civil Code which provides:\nARTICLE 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter.\nThus, the CA did not err when it upheld the award of damages imposed by the RTC against petitioner.\n\nUnder Article 2224 of the Civil Code, temperate damages may be recovered when pecuniary loss has been suffered but the amount cannot be proven with certainty. In such cases, the amount of the award is left to the discretion of the courts, according to the circumstances of each case, but it should be reasonable, considering that temperate damages should be more than nominal but less than compensatory.[35]\n\nHere, the lower courts made a factual finding that petitioner was negligent in selling the maggot-infested chocolate bars to respondents. This factual finding is deemed conclusive as the circumstances appearing on record convince the Court that respondents suffered some pecuniary loss. Nonetheless, it is difficult, if not impossible, to adduce solid proof of the damage suffered by respondents as a consequence of petitioner's negligence.[36] Hence, it is only proper that respondents be awarded temperate or moderate damages. In the case, and as held by the lower courts, the amount of P50,000.00 as temperate damages is reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nNonetheless, the award of P10,000.00 as actual damages in the dispositive portion of the RTC decision must be corrected. As expressly stated in the body of the RTC decision, the P10,000.00 awarded is for litigation expenses.[37] Thus, it is more accurate to denominate it as attorney's fees and not as actual damages. Verily, respondents are entitled to a reasonable amount of attorney's fees and litigation expenses pursuant to Article 2208(2)[38] of the Civil Code, considering that they were forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect their rights and interests.\n\nAlso, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence,[39] the Court imposes legal interest on the monetary awards at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum, reckoned from the finality of the Court's Resolution until their full payment.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The Decision dated July 26, 2019 and the Resolution dated July 6, 2020 of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City, in CA-G.R. CV No. 04759-MIN are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioner Gaisano Superstore, Inc. (Valencia City Branch) is ordered to pay respondents Spouses Frank Rhedey and Jocelyn Rhedey P50,000.00 as temperate damages and P10,000.00 as attorney's fees, both with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Resolution until fully paid.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCaguioa, (Chairperson), Gaerlan, Dimaampao, and Singh, JJ., concur.","label":[[17,32,"CASE_NUM"],[34,47,"PROM_DATE"],[50,74,"INS"],[123,135,"PERSON"],[140,154,"PERSON"],[189,199,"PERSON"],[213,218,"INS"],[267,296,"STA"],[414,430,"INS"],[432,434,"INS"],[460,484,"CASE_NUM"],[499,501,"INS"],[538,562,"INS"],[702,722,"INS"],[724,727,"INS"],[759,781,"CASE_NUM"],[821,833,"PERSON"],[838,852,"PERSON"],[1175,1206,"INS"],[1456,1468,"PERSON"],[1472,1477,"PERSON"],[1864,1884,"INS"],[1886,1889,"INS"],[1936,1939,"INS"],[2232,2235,"INS"],[2506,2509,"INS"],[3098,3101,"INS"],[3179,3182,"INS"],[3239,3242,"INS"],[3269,3272,"INS"],[3366,3371,"INS"],[3476,3482,"PERSON"],[3535,3542,"INS"],[3714,3717,"INS"],[3807,3833,"RA"],[4121,4124,"INS"],[4282,4285,"INS"],[4365,4367,"INS"],[4388,4390,"INS"],[4437,4439,"INS"],[4467,4470,"INS"],[4476,4478,"INS"],[4545,4548,"INS"],[4800,4805,"PERSON"],[4916,4945,"RA"],[4956,4958,"INS"],[5232,5234,"INS"],[5437,5439,"INS"],[5533,5538,"INS"],[5764,5767,"INS"],[5776,5778,"INS"],[6419,6424,"PERSON"],[6700,6703,"INS"],[6708,6710,"INS"],[6823,6830,"RA"],[7053,7055,"INS"],[7113,7118,"INS"],[7225,7230,"INS"],[7296,7303,"STA"],[7394,7422,"CASE_NUM"],[7469,7471,"INS"],[7511,7516,"INS"],[7887,7889,"INS"],[8054,8056,"INS"],[8384,8386,"INS"],[8641,8646,"INS"],[8739,8741,"INS"],[8766,8769,"INS"],[8992,8995,"INS"],[9015,9017,"INS"],[9205,9210,"INS"],[9318,9348,"STA"],[9365,9377,"STA"],[9686,9688,"INS"],[9752,9755,"INS"],[9783,9813,"STA"],[10420,10425,"INS"],[10936,10939,"INS"],[11007,11010,"INS"],[11276,11288,"STA"],[11479,11484,"INS"],[11608,11613,"INS"],[11792,11808,"INS"],[11834,11858,"CASE_NUM"],[11995,12007,"PERSON"],[12012,12026,"PERSON"],[12238,12245,"PERSON"],[12262,12269,"PERSON"],[12271,12280,"PERSON"],[12286,12291,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 218056, August 31, 2022 ]\nREPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE PRIVATIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OFFICE, PETITIONER, VS. CITY OF SURIGAO, AS REPRESENTED BY CITY MAYOR ERNESTO T. MATUGAS AND CITY TREASURER SARAH P. YAMIT, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nLOPEZ, M., J.:\n\nThe Court of Tax Appeals has the exclusive appellate jurisdiction over decisions, orders, or resolutions issued by the Regional Trial Court in a local tax case. This includes the power to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. We reiterate this dictum in this petition assailing the Decision[1] dated November 17, 2014 and Resolution[2] dated April 27, 2015 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 04987-MIN.\n\nAntecedents\n\nAsset Privatization Trust (APT) was created under Proclamation No. 50, series of 1986,[3] to take, for the benefit of the National Government, title to and possession of, conserve, provisionally manage, and dispose of assets that have been identified for privatization. On December 28, 1999, Republic Act (RA) No. 8758[4] was enacted, extending APT's term from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2000.[5]\n\nOn February 27, 1987, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) transferred its non-performing assets to APT, including, among others, the account of Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corporation (NMIC). Subsequently, on May 10, 1996, petitioner, through APT, entered into an Amended Restated Definitive Agreement (ARDA) with NMIC and Philnico Mining and Industrial Corporation (PMIC) for the sale to PMIC of the 22,500,000 shares of common stock of NMIC and certain receivables (Tranche B Receivables) of APT from NMIC.[6]\n\nOn September 27, 1999, petitioner, PMIC [now known as Philnico Industrial Corporation (PIC)], and NMIC [now known as Philnico Processing Corporation (PPC)] executed an Amendment Agreement[7] to revise the ARDA due to a change in the process technology of PPC's nickel refinery from ammonia leach process to acid leach process, and the effects of the economic problems affecting the Asia-Pacific Region on the financing, rehabilitation and operation of the nickel refinery. As a result, some existing facilities of the refinery were rendered redundant. Therefore, instead of negotiating for the corresponding reduction in the acquisition price of PPC's common stock and the receivables, including restructuring the payment terms of its obligation under the ARDA, PTC opted to return the redundant assets to APT with an estimated value of PHP 85,051,200.00.[8]\n \nUpon the expiration of APT's term on December 31, 2000 and under RA No. 8758 mandating the transfer of assets held by APT to a trust department of an appropriate government financial institution, former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada issued Executive Order (EO) No. 323[9] dated December 6, 2000, creating the Privatization and Management Office (PMO) under the Department of Finance, which took over the functions of the defunct APT.[10]\n\nOn June 6, 2006, the redundant assets were declared for real property taxation by the city assessor of Surigao City in accordance with Section 204[11] of the Local Government Code and classified the same as exempt from tax. On May 2, 2011, PMO received a letter[12] from Mayor Ernesto T. Matugas of respondent City Government of Surigao City requesting the payment of alleged outstanding Real Property Tax (RPT) on the redundant assets amounting to PHP 200,739,598.76, inclusive of penalties, as of December 31, 2010 within fifteen (15) days from receipt.[13] The subject redundant assets were then levied under a Notice of Levy issued by the City Treasurer as annotated on the Tax Declaration Nos. I-1500033 to I-1500041 and I-1500045.[14]\n\nPMO, through a letter dated June 22, 2011, protested the collection of RPT from the redundant assets as these were exempt, being properties of the government.[15] In turn, City Treasurer Sarah P. Yamit, in a letter[16] dated August 2, 2011, furnished PMO with a copy of the Advertisement of Sale at Public Auction of Delinquent Real Property[17] regarding the scheduled auction sale of the redundant assets at the Office of the City Treasurer on September 19, 2011 from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m.[18]\n\nThis prompted the petitioner to file a Petition for Prohibition with application for a Temporary Restraining Order and\/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction[19] before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 29 of Surigao City. Petitioner insisted that the collection of RPT is without basis because the redundant assets are owned by the Government and, thus, exempt from RPT. On September 15, 2011, the RTC directed the Local Government of Surigao City not to conduct any public bidding until the application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) filed by petitioner has been resolved.[20]\n\nOn June 15, 2012, the RTC issued its Resolution[21] denying petitioner's application for writ of preliminary injunction. The decretal portion reads:\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, petitioner's application for the Writ of Preliminary Injunction is hereby DENIED for lack of legal and factual bases.\n\nRespondent City may proceed with the auction sale of the redundant assets subject to the observance of the proper procedures under Section 258 of the Local Government Code.\n\nSO ORDERED.[22]\nOn July 5, 2012, petitioner moved to reconsider RTC's adverse ruling.[23]\n\nOn July 9, 2012, petitioner was able to secure once again a copy of the advertisement for sale, setting the auction sale of the redundant assets on July 16, 2012. Thus, petitioner was constrained to file a petition for certiorari[24] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with the CA and withdrew its motion for reconsideration lodged with the RTC, in conformity with the rule against forum shopping.[25]\n\nIn its Resolution dated July 13, 2012, the CA granted petitioner's prayer for the issuance of a TRO enjoining respondent City \"from further proceeding with, and conducting, the scheduled auction sale of the subject real properties on July 16, 2012.\" On November 17, 2014, the CA rendered the assailed Decision[26] denying the Petition for Certiorari solely on technical grounds, i.e., (1) that a motion for reconsideration is a condition sine qua non for the filing of a certiorari petition, which petitioner did not pursue, and (2) that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies in questioning the tax collection on the subject properties by immediately filing the petition for prohibition before the RTC.[27]\n\nPetitioner sought to reconsider the assailed Decision, but the CA denied its motion in its Resolution dated April 27, 2015.[28]\n\nHence, the present petition for review on certiorari, with urgent application for an ex-parte temporary restraining order and\/or writ of preliminary injunction.[29]\n \nOn July 6, 2015, the Court, without necessarily giving due course to the petition, issued a Temporary Restraining Order[30] (TRO) enjoining the City of Surigao, as represented by City Mayor Ernesto Matugas, and the City Treasurer Sarah Yamit, from proceeding with the auction sale of the subject properties covered by the Advertisement and Sale at Public Action of Delinquent Real Property dated June 22, 2012, effective immediately and continuing until further orders from the Court.\n\nRuling\n\nWe deny the petition. The petition for certiorari questioning the RTC's denial of the application for a writ of injunction was filed in the wrong court.\n\nUnder Section 7(a)(3) of RA No. 1125, as amended by RA No. 9282,[31] the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) has the exclusive appellate jurisdiction over local tax cases, including cases involving real property taxes,[32] decided by the RTC.[33] The CTA's jurisdiction includes the power to issue writs of certiorari over interlocutory orders issued by the RTC in a local tax case.[34]\n\nIn City of Manila v. Grecia-Cuerdo,[35] the Court ruled that while there is no express grant of power to the CTA to issue writs of certiorari under RA No. 1125, as amended, the Constitution provides, nonetheless, that \"'judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law[;] judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.\" The Court elaborated:\nOn the strength of the above constitutional provisions, it can be fairly interpreted that the power of the CTA includes that of determining whether or not there has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the RTC in issuing an interlocutory order in cases falling within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the tax court. It, thus, follows that the CTA, by constitutional mandate, is vested with jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari in these cases.\n \nIndeed, in order for any appellate court, to effectively exercise its appellate jurisdiction, it must have the authority to issue, among others, a writ of certiorari. In transferring exclusive jurisdiction over appealed tax cases to the CTA, it can reasonably be assumed that the law intended to transfer also such power as is deemed necessary, if not indispensable, in aid of such appellate jurisdiction. There is no perceivable reason why the transfer should only be considered as partial, not total.\n\nx x x x\n\nFurthermore, Section 6, Rule 135 of the present Rules of Court provides that when by law, jurisdiction is conferred on a court or judicial officer, all auxiliary writs, processes and other means necessary to carry it into effect may be employed by such court or officer.\n\nIf this Court were to sustain petitioners' contention that jurisdiction over their certiorari petition lies with the CA, this Court would be confirming the exercise by two judicial bodies, the CA and the CTA, of jurisdiction over basically the same subject matter — precisely the split­-jurisdiction situation which is anathema to the orderly administration of justice. The Court cannot accept that such was the legislative motive, especially considering that the law expressly confers on the CTA, the tribunal with the specialized competence over tax and tariff matters, the role of judicial review over local tax cases without mention of any other court that may exercise such power. Thus, the Court agrees with the ruling of the CA that since appellate jurisdiction over private respondents' complaint for tax refund is vested in the CTA, it follows that a petition for certiorari seeking nullification of an interlocutory order issued in the said case should, likewise, be filed with the same court. To rule otherwise would lead to an absurd situation where one court decides an appeal in the main case while another court rules on an incident in the very same case.\n\nStated differently, it would be somewhat incongruent with the pronounced judicial abhorrence to split jurisdiction to conclude that the intention of the law is to divide the authority over a local tax case filed with the RTC by giving to the CA or this Court jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari against interlocutory orders of the RTC but giving to the CTA the jurisdiction over the appeal from the decision of the trial court in the same case. It is more in consonance with logic and legal soundness to conclude that the grant of appellate jurisdiction to the CTA over tax cases filed in and decided by the RTC carries with it the power to issue a writ of certiorari when necessary in aid of such appellate jurisdiction. The supervisory power or jurisdiction of the CTA to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of its appellate jurisdiction should co-exist with, and be a complement to, its appellate jurisdiction to review, by appeal, the final orders and decisions of the RTC, in order to have complete supervision over the acts of the latter.\n\nA grant of appellate jurisdiction implies that there is included in it the power necessary to exercise it effectively, to make all orders that will preserve the subject of the action, and to give effect to the final determination of the appeal. It carries with it the power to protect that jurisdiction and to make the decisions of the court thereunder effective. The court, in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, has authority to control all auxiliary and incidental matters necessary to the efficient and proper exercise of that jurisdiction. For this purpose, it may, when necessary, prohibit or restrain the performance of any act which might interfere with the proper exercise of its rightful jurisdiction in cases pending before it.[36]\nAccordingly, the CTA's exclusive appellate jurisdiction over a decision of the RTC in a local tax case necessarily includes determining whether the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing an interlocutory order relative to the main action. \"The supervisory power or jurisdiction of the CTA to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of its appellate jurisdiction should co-exist with, and be a complement to, its appellate jurisdiction to review, by appeal, the final orders and decisions of the RTC, in order to have complete supervision over the acts of the latter.\"[37]\n\nIt must be stressed that the CTA's appellate jurisdiction in Section 7(a)(3) of RA No. 1125, as amended, becomes operative only when the RTC has ruled on a local tax case. This means that the action before the RTC must be in the nature of a tax case or one which primarily involves a tax issue. A local tax case may involve the legality or validity of the real property tax assessment, protests of assessments, disputed assessments, surcharges, or penalties; the validity of a tax ordinance; claims for tax refund\/credit; claims for tax exemption; actions to collect the tax due; and even prescription of assessments.[38]\n\nIn Mactel Corp. v. City Government of Makati,[39] we ruled that the CTA should have dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The issue did not involve a local tax case but was civil in nature.\nHere, petitioner's argument in disputing the local tax assessment does not involve the application of tax laws because this issue has already been resolved with finality when petitioner secured a final and executory judgment embodied in the Decision dated November 13, 2007. What petitioner seeks instead is to enforce the said final and executory judgment.\n\nEven the trial court, in its Order dated August 6, 2015, acknowledged this, and held that:\n[Petitioner] herein did not directly protest the assessment which as of the moment, is the subject of proper proceedings with [respondent] City Treasurer. What it seeks to correct is the previous acts committed by [respondents], particularly the very basis of the assessments it issued and its relation to the effects of the Decision dated 13 November 2007. The issue shall be delved into deeply by this Court once it goes into the merits of the instant Petition. At this point, this Court understands that [petitioner] does not seek to protest the amount of the assessment, but based upon its Petition, it merely seeks to define its rights under the Decision dated 13 November 2007.\nTo reiterate, the local tax case that may be elevated to the trial court and eventually to the CTA is the deficiency business tax assessment for taxable years 2010-2013 which was still under administrative review at the time petitioner filed the petition for declaratory relief. Upon denial of petitioner's protest, it would inevitably elevate the same to the court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nWhereas in this case, what are being questioned are the interlocutory orders issued by the RTC which did not rule on the validity of the assessments but merely ordered respondents to refrain from proceeding further with the assessments until the computation of petitioner's business taxes has been determined in accordance with the previous final and executory Decision. Likewise, the RTC's order for respondents to issue a temporary business permit to petitioner was merely to prevent grave and irreparable damage to petitioner while the main case before the trial court is still ongoing. Clearly, the assailed orders of the RTC are not issued in a local tax case contemplated under Section 7(a)(3) of the R.A. 9282.[40]\nIn Ignacio v. Office of the City Treasurer of Quezon City,[41] the case was related to collecting tax deficiencies. However, the Court ruled that it was not a local tax case over which the CTA could have properly assumed jurisdiction. The action filed with the RTC was essentially one for recovery of ownership and possession of the property, which is not anchored on a tax issue but due on process considerations. Thus, the case was correctly elevated to the CA, viz.:\nIn this case, a reading of the Annulment Complaint shows that Teresa's action before the RTC-Br. 85 is essentially one for recovery of ownership and possession of the property, with damages, which is not anchored on a tax issue, but on due process considerations. Particularly, she alleged that: (a) public respondents sent the Notice of Delinquency in July 2008, and the corresponding Warrant of Levy in May 2009, to a wrong address; (b) they knew her correct address as early as March 2007, or before they sent the Notice and Warrant; (c) she had in fact already filed an action against them involving a different property, for likewise sending the notice to a wrong address; and (d) their willful violation of her right to notice of the levy and auction sale deprived her of her right to take the necessary steps and action to prevent the sale of the property, participate in the auction sale, or otherwise redeem the property from Sps. Dimalanta. In other words, the Annulment Complaint's allegations do not contest the tax assessment on the property, as Teresa only bewails the alleged lack of due process which deprived her of the opportunity to participate in the delinquency sale proceedings. As such, the RTC-Br. 85's ruling thereon could not be characterized as a local tax case over which the CTA could have properly assumed jurisdiction on appeal. In fine, the case was correctly elevated to the CA. (Emphasis supplied)\nOn the other hand, the petition for injunction filed before the RTC in City of Lapu-Lapu v. Phil. Economic Zone Authority[42] was a local tax case. The PEZA sought to enjoin the collection of its alleged real property taxes on the ground that it is exempt from the payment of RPT. The RTC denied its petition so it filed a petition for certiorari with the CA. The Court ruled that the proper remedy was to file an appeal to the CTA.\n[T]he PEZA's petition for certiorari was filed before the wrong court. The PEZA should have filed its petition before the Court of Tax Appeals.\n\nThe Court of Tax Appeals has the exclusive appellate jurisdiction over local tax cases decided by Regional Trial Courts. Section 7, paragraph (a)(3) of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended by Republic Act No. 9282. provides:\nSec. 7. Jurisdiction. — The [Court of Tax Appeals] shall exercise:\n\na. Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:\n\nx x x x\n\n3. Decisions, orders or resolutions of the Regional Trial Courts in local tax cases originally decided or resolved by them in the exercise of their original or appellate jurisdiction[.]\nThe local tax cases referred to in Section 7, paragraph (a) (3) of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, include cases involving real property taxes. Real property taxation is governed by Book II of the Local Government Code on \"Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters.\" Real property taxes are collected by the Local Treasurer, not by the Bureau of Internal Revenue in charge of collecting national internal revenue taxes, fees, and charges.\n\nSection 7, paragraph (a)(5) of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended by Republic Act No. 9282, separately provides for the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals over decisions of the Central Board of Assessment Appeals involving the assessment or collection of real property taxes:\nSec. 7. Jurisdiction. — The [Court of Tax Appeals] shall exercise:\n\na. Exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided:\n\nx x x x\n\n5. Decisions of the Central Board of Assessment Appeals in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction over cases involving the assessment and taxation of real property originally decided by the provincial or city board of assessment appeals[.]\nThis separate provision, nevertheless, does not bar the Court of Tax Appeals from taking cognizance of trial court decisions involving the collection of real property tax cases. Sections 256 and 266 of the Local Government Code expressly allow local government units to file \"in any court of competent jurisdiction\" civil actions to collect basic real property taxes. Should the, trial court rule against them, local government units cannot be barred from appealing before the Court of Tax Appeals — the \"highly specialized body specifically created for the purpose of reviewing tax cases.\"\n\nWe have also ruled that the Court of Tax Appeals, not the Court of Appeals, has the exclusive original jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari assailing interlocutory orders issued by Regional Trial Courts in a local tax case. We explained in The City of Manila v. Hon. Grecia-Cuerdo that while the Court of Tax Appeals has no express grant of power to issue writs of certiorari under Republic Act No. 1125, 214 as amended, the tax court's judicial power as defined in the Constitution includes the power to determine \"whether or not there has been grave abuse or discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the [Regional Trial Court] in issuing an interlocutory order of jurisdiction in cases falling within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the tax court.\"\n\nx x x x\n\nIn this case, the petition for injunction filed before the Regional Trial Court of Pasay was a local tax case originally decided by the trial court in its original jurisdiction. Since the PEZA assailed a judgment, not an interlocutory order, of the Regional Trial Court, the PEZA's proper remedy was an appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals.[43] (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn National Power Corp. v. Provincial Government of Bataan,[44] the case involved the validity and legality of the foreclosure sale, which is related to the demandability of the local franchise tax – a local tax issue. We ruled that the CA correctly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nThe case a quo is a local tax case that is within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals. Parenthetically, the case arose from the dispute between Napocor and respondents over the purported franchise tax delinquency of Napocor. Although the complaint filed with the trial court is a Petition for declaration of nullity of foreclosure sale with prayer for preliminary mandatory injunction, a reading of the petition shows that it essentially assails the correctness of the local franchise tax assessments by the Provincial Government of Bataan. Indeed, one of the prayers in the petition is for the court a quo to declare Napocor \"as exempt from payment of local franchise taxes.\" Basic is the rule that allegations in the complaint and the character of the relief sought determine the nature of an action. In order for the trial court to resolve the complaint, the issues regarding the correctness of the tax assessment and collection must also necessarily be dealt with. As correctly ruled by the Court of Appeals, \"the issue of the validity and legality of the foreclosure sale is essentially related to the issue of the demandability of the local franchise tax.\"[45] (Boldfacing supplied; italics in the original)\nSimilarly, the instant case primarily involves a tax issue. Petitioner was questioning the denial of its application for a writ of injunction to enjoin the respondents from selling the redundant assets in consequence of its alleged unpaid RPT. In particular, petitioner claimed in its Petition for Prohibition with application for a Temporary Restraining Order and\/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction[46] that the properties sought to be auctioned are owned by the Government and thus, exempt from the payment of RPT. Being in the nature of a local tax case, the petitioner should have filed the petition with the CTA and not with the CA.\n\nThe appellate jurisdiction of the CTA is to the exclusion of all other courts.[47] The CA should have dismissed the petitioner's certiorari petition for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, the CA's decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04987-MIN is void.[48]\n\nACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated November 17, 2014 and the Resolution dated April 27, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 04987-MIN are SET ASIDE. The Petition for Certiorari filed by petitioner with the Court of Appeals assailing the Resolution dated June 15, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 29 of Surigao City in Special Civil Action No. 7450 is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe Temporary Restraining Order dated July 6, 2015 is LIFTED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nLeonen, SAJ.

{"id":9,"text":"THIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 249681, August 31, 2022 ]\nESTATE OF MURRAY PHILIP WILLIAMS, AS REPRESENTED BY DENIS MICHAEL STANLEY, PETITIONER, VS. WILLIAM VICTOR PERCY, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nGAERLAN, J.:\n\nThis is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, assailing the Resolutions dated April 24, 2019[2] and September 26, 2019[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 159020. The assailed issuances dismissed outright petitioner Denis Michael Stanley's (Stanley's) petition for certiorari, filed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, for failure to acquire jurisdiction over the person of respondent William Victor Percy (Percy).\n\nAntecedents\n\nFollowing the death of Murray Philip Williams (Williams), Letters of Administration[4] were issued by Branch 72 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Olongapo City in favor of Stanley on July 22, 2014 in Special Proceeding Case No. 65-0-12.[5]\n\nOn August 12, 2015, Stanley filed, on behalf of the Estate of Williams, a Complaint-Affidavit[6] for carnapping and estafa against Percy before the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Olongapo City, Zambales. Stanley alleged that prior to his death, Williams entrusted two of his cars to Percy for safekeeping, specifically: a red 2007 Mercedes Benz ML500 with Plate No. ZGE-201[7] and a white platinum metallic 2011 Ford Expedition 4x4 AT Eddie Bauer EL with Engine No. AEB52740 and Chassis No. 1FMJK1J5XAEB52740.[8] When Stanley demanded[9] the return of the said vehicles, Percy failed to do so.[10] As a result, Stanley was constrained to file a criminal complaint against him.\n\nIn his Counter-Affidavit,[11] Percy denied that the two vehicles were entrusted to him by Williams. He asserted that the same were the subject of a transaction between Williams and one William James Wardle, the details of which he was not privy to.[12]\n\nOn June 30, 2016, the Office of the City Prosecutor, Olongapo City issued a Resolution[13] finding probable cause to file a criminal case for two counts of carnapping against Percy. Thus, Percy was indicted by virtue of two Informations dated August 22, 2016, the accusatory portions of which state:\n\nCriminal Case No. 2016-1504\nThat on or about the month of January 2011, in the City of Olongapo, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with intent to gain and without the consent of the owner, complainant Estate of Murray Philip Williams, represented by its duly appointed administrator, Denis Michael Estanley [sic], did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away a Red 2007 Mercedez [sic] Benz ML500 with plate number ZGE201, engine number 112964300744324 and chassis number 4JGBB75E87A180151, which belonged to the deceased [Murray] Philip Williams.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.[14]\n\nCriminal Case No. 2016-1505\n\nThat on or about the month of January 2011, in the City of Olongapo, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with intent to gain and without the consent of the owner, complainant Estate of Murray Philip Williams, represented by its duly appointed administrator, Denis Michael Estanley [sic], did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away a White Platinum Metallic 2011 Ford Expedition EL engine number AEB52740 and chassis number 1FMJKIJ5XAE52740, which belonged to the deceased [Murray] Philip Williams.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.[15]\nThe cases were consolidated and raffled to Branch 72 of the RTC of Olongapo City. During the trial, the prosecution was able to present its documentary and testimonial evidence. Afterwards, it made a Formal Offer of Documentary Evidence.[16]\n\nThereafter, Percy filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Demurrer to Evidence,[17] followed by the corresponding Demurrer to Evidence.[18] He prayed for the dismissal of the case on the ground that the evidence adduced by the prosecution were all insufficient to prove the presence of the elements of the crime of carnapping.[19]\n\nOn October 16, 2018, the RTC issued an Order[20] granting the demurrer to evidence, reasoning that the prosecution failed to adduce the quantum of evidence required to convict Percy of two counts of carnapping. Thus:\nIN VIEW THEREOF, the demurrer to evidence filed by accused William Victor Percy is hereby GRANTED. Consequently, these cases are hereby ordered DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED.[21]\nDispensing with the filing of a motion for reconsideration,[22] and admittedly without securing the conformity of the People through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG),[23] Stanley filed with the CA a Petition for Certiorari[24] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. He asserted, as a sole ground, that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in granting Percy's demurrer to evidence \"DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROSECUTION WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME CHARGED AND DESPITE ALL AVAILABLE JURISPRUDENTIAL PRECEDENTS.\"[25]\n\nOn April 14, 2019, the CA issued the first assailed Resolution[26] dismissing the petition for failure on the part of Stanley to serve the same to Percy's current and complete address. The pertinent portions of the said issuance reads:\nOn 05 March 2019, the Court required the petitioner to inform the current and complete address of private respondent within five (5) days from notice, otherwise, the Petition may be dismissed for failure to acquire jurisdiction over the person of the latter, pursuant to Section 4, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court.\n\nInstead of complying with the Court' s directive, petitioner filed a Manifestation with Omnibus Motion insisting that service of the Petition upon private respondent's counsel should be deemed sufficient, inasmuch as the pleadings filed by said private respondent before the court a quo all bear his counsel's address. In the alternative, petitioner seeks for a thirty (30)-day period within which to submit the required complete and current address of the private respondent.\n\nWe find petitioner's explanation unsatisfactory.\n\nSection 3, Rule 46 of the Rules requires that the petition be filed together with proof of service thereof on the respondent. Corollary thereto, Section 4, Rule 46 of the same Rules states that jurisdiction over the person of the respondent shall be acquired by service on him of the Court's order or resolution indicating Our initial action on the petition or by voluntary submission to such jurisdiction.\n\nIt [is] evident that both proof of service of the Petition to the private respondent AND service on him of the Court's order or resolution on its initial action are required for the Petition to prosper. However, petitioner only furnished private respondent's counsel a copy of the Petition, without serving a copy on the respondent himself. The service of the Petition upon the person of the respondent, and not upon his counsel, is what the Rules properly require, and not the other way around.\n\nx x x x\n\nIt may be true that petitioner alternatively prays for an extension of thirty (30) days within which to comply with the Court's directive. However, petitioner failed to offer any reason why the Court should grant the same. Even the oft-repeated phrase, \"in the interest of justice,\" was not invoked. Hence, We find no reason why leniency on the application of the Rules should be accorded in absence of any justifiable or meritorious explanation.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Manifestation With Omnibus Motion is hereby DENIED and the instant Petition is DISMISSED.\n\nAccordingly, the case [is] deemed CLOSED and TERMINATED.\n\nSO ORDERED.[27]\nStanley filed a Motion for Reconsideration[28] arguing that contrary to the CA' s conclusion, the appellate court had in fact acquired jurisdiction over the person of Percy. Stanley points to Percy's Comment to Petition[29] dated March 18, 2019 which was filed before the CA. In the said comment, Percy prayed for the outright dismissal of the petition on the ground that only the People, through the OSG, may question an acquittal in a criminal case.\n\nThe CA denied Stanley's motion in the second assailed Resolution[30] dated September 26, 2019.\n\nHence, the present recourse.\n\nArguments\n\nStanley beseeches the Court to order the CA to give due course to his petition for certiorari. He contends that by interposing a comment to the said petition without expressing any objections, Percy voluntarily submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the appellate court; and that the case should be decided on the merits and not on technicalities.[31]\n\nOn the other hand, Percy, in his Comment to Petition,[32] contended that the instant petition be dismissed because it seeks to appeal an acquittal which only the OSG has the authority to do.\n\nIn his Reply,[33] Stanley asseverated that the Estate of Williams is not precluded from questioning the civil aspect of the case on its own. He contended that because the Estate of Williams never made any reservation on separately pursuing the civil aspect of the case, it maintains an interest on the dismissal of the criminal aspect thereof.[34]\n\nIssue\n\nThe Court is tasked to determine whether the CA erred in dismissing outright the petition filed by Stanley in his capacity as administrator of the Estate of Williams.\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nI.\n\nJurisdiction is the power and authority of the court to hear, try and decide a case.[35] Being a matter of substantive law,[36] it pertains to the right of the court to act in a case.[37] In order for the court or an adjudicative body to have authority to dispose of the case on the merits, it must acquire jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.[38]\n\nJurisdiction over the subject matter is the power to hear and determine the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.[39] Conferred by the Constitution[40] or given by law and in the manner prescribed by law,[41] jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the allegations in the complaint, including the character of the reliefs prayed for.[42]\n\nOn the other hand, jurisdiction over the person or the parties, or jurisdiction in personam, refers to the power of the court to render a personal judgment or to subject the parties in a particular action to the judgment and other rulings rendered in the action.[43] It is the power of the court to make decisions that are binding on persons.[44] It is an element of due process that is essential in all actions, civil as well as criminal, except in actions in rem or quasi in rem.[45]\n\nThe instant case involves the determination of whether the CA validly acquired jurisdiction over the person of Percy.\n\nIn original cases filed before the CA, such as the subject petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court that Stanley filed a quo, the appellate court acquires jurisdiction over the person of a respondent by serving upon him or her an order or resolution indicating its initial action on the said petition. Rule 46, Section 4 so states:\nSEC. 4. Jurisdiction over the person of respondent, how acquired. — The court shall acquire jurisdiction over the person of the respondent by the service on him of its order or resolution indicating its initial action on the petition or by his voluntary submission to such jurisdiction.\nIn order for the CA to be able to effect the said order or resolution upon the person of a respondent to a petition, it is incumbent upon a petitioner to inform the CA of said respondent's complete address. This is accomplished by furnishing the CA with a proof of service of the petition on the respondent concerned, as provided by Rule 4, Section 3.[46]\n\nNevertheless, it bears stressing that jurisdiction over the person of a defendant or respondent, as the case may be, is also acquired through his or her voluntary appearance in court and submission to its authority.[47] There is voluntary appearance when a party, without directly assailing the court's lack of jurisdiction, seeks affirmative relief from the court.[48]\n\nIn the instant case, Percy voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the CA when he filed a Comment to Petition dated March 18, 2019 praying for the outright dismissal of Stanley's petition for certiorari on the sole ground that it was not filed with the authority or conformity of the OSG.[49] His voluntary appearance is equivalent to service.[50]\n\nPrescinding from the foregoing, one may readily conclude that the CA was too hasty in dismissing Stanley's petition for certiorari and, as a result, it is incumbent upon this Court to remand the case to the CA and direct the appellate court to give due course thereto. However, because this Court has the solemn duty to protect the Constitution and the constitutional rights of individuals,[51] particularly Percy's, We cannot do so.\n\nII.\n\nEven if the Court were to remand the instant case to the CA, the eventual outcome will be the same. It will be dismissed because (1) it was filed without the conformity or authority of the OSG; and (2) it violates Percy's right against double jeopardy.\n\nII. A.\n\nIn the appeal of criminal cases before the CA or the Supreme Court, the authority to represent the People is vested solely in the Solicitor General.[52] That is, only the OSG may bring or defend actions in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines, or represent the People or State in criminal proceedings before the Supreme Court and the CA.[53] Stanley acknowledges this much in his Reply.[54]\n\nNevertheless, in a bid to circumvent the foregoing rule, Stanley backpedaled and asserted that he was actually seeking to protect the rights of the Estate of Williams insofar as the civil aspect of the case is concerned.\n\nWe reject Stanley's lame excuse.\n\nA reading of Stanley's Petition for Certiorari[55] with the CA readily shows that not a single sentence in the said pleading discusses the civil aspect of the criminal cases filed against Percy. The entirety of said petition uniformly contends that the trial court erred in its evaluation of the evidence adduced by the prosecution when it granted Percy's demurrer to evidence. Every single paragraph limited itself to the discussion of the elements of the crime of carnapping and why the trial court erred in acquitting Percy.\n\nAt the risk of being repetitious, it is worth noting, at this juncture, that the assignment of error in Stanley's petition for certiorari before the CA made one solitary contention, that: \"THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT GRANTED THE ACCUSED'S DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROSECUTION WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME CHARGED AND DESPITE ALL AVAILABLE JURISPRUDENTIAL PRECEDENTS.\"[56]\n\nIt is crystal clear that Stanley was seeking to appeal an acquittal in a criminal case despite knowing all along that he had neither the right nor the authority to do so.\n\nIn any event, granting arguendo that Stanley was truthfully questioning the civil aspect of the suject criminal cases, the fact remains that he instituted his petition for certiorari before the CA without first filing a motion for reconsideration with the RTC.\n\nThe rule is that a motion for reconsideration is a condition sine qua non for the filing of a petition for certiorari.[57] Its purpose is to grant an opportunity for the court to correct any actual or perceived error attributed to it by the re-examination of the legal and factual circumstances of the case.[58] While this rule admits of exceptions,[59] none of which is obtaining in this case. Stanley cannot arrogate to himself the determination of whether a motion for reconsideration is necessary or not.[60]\n\nII. B.\n\nSettled is the principle that an order granting a demurrer to evidence is a judgment on the merits[61] and is tantamount to an acquittal.[62] We adhere to the finality-of-acquittal doctrine which edifies the principle that a judgment of acquittal is final and unappealable.[63] Any attempt to overturn an acquittal runs afoul of an accused's right against double jeopardy as provided in Section 21,[64] Article III of the Constitution.\n\nIn People v. Sandiganbayan,[65] We explained:\nThe demurrer to evidence in criminal cases, such as the one at bar, is \"filed after the prosecution had rested its case,\" and when the same is granted, it calls \"for an appreciation of the evidence adduced by the prosecution and its sufficiency to warrant conviction beyond reasonable doubt, resulting in a dismissal of the case on the merits, tantamount to an acquittal of the accused.\" Such dismissal of a criminal case by the grant of demurrer to evidence may not be appealed, for to do so would be to place the accused in double jeopardy. The verdict being one of acquittal, the case ends there.[66] (Citations omitted)\nCase law provides only one exception to the finality-of-acquittal doctrine, i.e., when the trial court has acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction such as where the prosecution was denied the opportunity to present its case or where the trial was a sham, thus, rendering the assailed judgment void.[67]\n\nHere, records show that the prosecution completed the presentation of all its documentary and testimonial evidence during the trial without a hitch. It was also able to make a formal offer of evidence. The trial was not a sham. The aforementioned exception, therefore, does not apply in this case. Directing the CA to give due course to Stanley's petition for certiorari would be tantamount to placing Percy twice in jeopardy for criminal offenses that he had already been acquitted from.\n\nAll told, We find that the CA erred in concluding that it was not able to acquire jurisdiction over the person of Percy. Nonetheless, because it is the mandate of the Court to put primacy on constitutional safeguards of human life and liberty,[68] this Court cannot remand the case to the CA for further proceedings because Stanley had no authority to file the said petition in the first place; and, more importantly, because doing so would violate Percy's right against double jeopardy.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nHernando,* Dimaampao and Singh, JJ., concur.\nCaguioa, J.

{"id":10,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 255864, July 06, 2022 ]\nUNIVERSAL ROBINA CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. ROBERTO DE GUZMAN MAGLALANG, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nLOPEZ, M., J.:\n\nThis Court resolves Universal Robina Corporation's (URC) Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) September 15, 2020 Decision[2] and February 8, 2021 Resolution[3] in CA-G.R. SP No. 155421, which reversed the National Labor Relations Commission's (NLRC) December 29, 2017 Decision[4] and January 31, 2018 Resolution[5] in NLRC LAC No. 12-003716-17\/NLCR NCR Case No. 05-07755-17, finding respondent Roberto De Guzman Maglalang's (Roberto) dismissal valid.\nFacts of the Case\n\nIn his complaint, Roberto alleged that he started working as URC's machine operator on November 17, 1997. On March 26, 2015, he went to the parking lot to clean his motorcycle seat using the alcohol provided by the company for the employees' use within the company premises. Afterward, he submitted a bag for inspection before going home. The security guard noticed a bottle. Roberto realized that the alcohol was still in his bag. Roberto panicked and threw the bottle away before the security guard could retrieve it. When the security guard recovered the bottle, he discovered that it contained ethyl alcohol belonging to the company. Roberto was brought to the police station for investigation. The following day, he was criminally charged with qualified theft. He was detained at the police station for five days and was placed under preventive suspension for 30 days, which was extended for another 30 days.[6]\n\nOn March 27, 2015, URC issued a Notice to Explain, informing Roberto of the charges[7] against him and giving him five days to submit a written explanation. Roberto submitted a written explanation to the union, but URC refused to accept it. He also asked for the union's help to be reinstated, but to no avail.[8]\n\nFor its part, URC alleged that Roberto failed to submit a written explanation, so they gave him another opportunity to present his side.[9] In an administrative hearing held on April 27, 2015, Roberto admitted that he took the bottle but denied stealing it. URC was not convinced. Thus, on May 14, 2015, URC issued a Notice of Termination.[10]\n\nURC added that during the pendency of the criminal case, they received various apology letters with pleas for the withdrawal of the criminal case and reinstatement from Roberto. On July 15, 2016, the parties entered into a compromise agreement wherein they agreed to waive any and all claims or cause of actions that they may have against one another, given URC's withdrawal of the criminal case. However, URC denied Roberto's request for reinstatement and payment of money claims. On August 23, 2016, the criminal case against Roberto was dismissed. But then, Roberto filed an illegal dismissal case against URC.[11]\n\nOn September 29, 2017, the Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the case for lack of merit. The LA found Roberto guilty of serious misconduct for theft of company property. The LA ordered URC to pay Roberto P12,939.81, representing the balance of his money claims,[12] thus:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the complaint for illegal dismissal is DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nHowever, respondent [URC] is ordered to pay complainant [P]12,939.81 representing the balance of his money claims, after deducting government loans in the amount of [P]13,843.50 and [P]15,249.66 from Pag-ibig and SSS, respectively.\n\nSO ORDERED.[13]\n\nIn a Decision[14] dated December 29, 2017, the NLRC upheld the LA's findings that Roberto was validly dismissed for committing serious misconduct.\n\nUnable to secure a reconsideration,[15] Roberto filed a petition for certiorari with the CA.[16] He argued that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed his complaint for illegal dismissal.\n\nOn September 15, 2020, the CA issued a Decision[17] finding that Roberto was illegally dismissed. The CA ruled that Roberto was only guilty of simple misconduct because URC recovered the bottle of alcohol, and its value was only P60.00. Roberto was also not guilty of willful breach of trust because he was not occupying a position of trust and confidence. With this, the penalty of dismissal was not commensurate with the misconduct. However, since reinstatement was no longer possible because of strained relations between the parties, the CA granted Roberto separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, with backwages.[18] The dispositive part of the CA's Decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is GRANTED. The Decision and Resolution dated 29 December 2017 and 19 February 2018, respectively, of the [NLRC], Sixth Division in NLRC LAC No. 12-003716-17 \/ RAB Case No. 05-07755-17 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. A new judgment is ENTERED finding [Roberto] as illegally dismissed from his employment by [URC]. Furthermore, the [LA] of origin is DIRECTED to compute the following with dispatch:\n\n[Roberto's] backwages from the time his salary was withheld on 26 March 2015 up to the date of finality of this Decision;\n\n[Roberto's] separation pay from the date he was employed on 17 November 1997 up to the date of finality of this Decision.\n[URC] is also ordered to pay [Roberto] attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total monetary award. Furthermore, the total monetary award shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.\n\nSO ORDERED.[19]\n\nURC moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied it in a February 8, 2021 Resolution.[20]\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nParties' Arguments\n\nURC insists that Roberto was validly dismissed because theft of company property is serious misconduct. Roberto's length of service, the value of the item, and its recovery does not decrease the gravity of the offense. His actions manifest his inexcusable irresponsibility and expose his depravity and scorn for disciplinary rules. These caused damage to URC's interest and constituted a willful breach of trust. Besides, the compromise agreement bars Roberto from filing any claim arising from his act of theft. Hence, he is not entitled to separation pay, backwages, and attorney's fees.[21]\n\nAs a defense, Roberto avers that his misconduct is not serious because the item only costs P60.00, and URC was able to recover it from him. He maintains that he does not occupy a position of trust and confidence. Roberto also argues that the compromise agreement does not preclude him from filing a labor case against URC because it only pertains to the crime of theft and has nothing to do with his employment. For these reasons, he was illegally dismissed. Thus, he is entitled to his money claims.[22]\n\nCourt's Ruling\n\nThe petition is partly meritorious.\n\nThe Rules of Court provides that a review under Rule 45 is a matter of judicial discretion and will be granted only when there are special and important reasons. In Miro v. Vda. de Erederos,[23] the Court identified the parameters of a judicial review under Rule 45, i.e., limitations on questions of law and errors of the appellate court.[24] A case presents a question of law when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts. In other words, \"[t]he resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances.\"[25] Here, the facts are not disputed. As such, the Court is only confronted with the issue of whether the value of the company property stolen, damage to the company, and employee's length of service may be considered in determining the gravity of the misconduct committed.\n\nUnquestionably, employers have the right to discipline and terminate their employees.[26]\n\nArticle 297 [282] of the Labor Code provides the just causes for dismissal of employees, thus:\n\nART. 297. [282] Termination by Employer. — An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:\n\n(a) Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;\n\n(b) Gross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties;\n\n(c) Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative;\n\n(d) Commission of a crime or offense by the employee against the person of his employer or any immediate member of his family or his duly authorized representatives; and\n\n(e) Other causes analogous to the foregoing. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nFraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative.\n\n\"Misconduct is x x x improper or wrong conduct. It is the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, [or a willful] dereliction of duty, x x x and implies a wrongful intent[.]\"[27] To be a just cause for dismissal, \"(a) the misconduct must be serious; (b) it must relate to the performance of the employee's duties showing that the employee has become unfit to continue working for the employer; and (c) it must have been performed with wrongful intent.\"[28] On the other hand, loss of trust and confidence can be a ground for dismissal when:\n\n(1)\nthe employee concerned must be holding a position of trust and confidence; and\n\n\n(2)\nthere must be an act that would justify the loss of trust and confidence. And in order to constitute a just cause for dismissal, the act complained of must be work-related such as would show the employee concerned to be unfit to continue working for the employer.[29] (Citation omitted)\nThe employers' \"right is, however, subject to [the State's] reasonable regulation x x x in the exercise of its police power. Accordingly, the finding that an employee violated company rules and regulations is subject to scrutiny by the Court to determine if the dismissal is justified and, if so, whether the penalty imposed is commensurate to the gravity of his offense.\"[30]\n\nIn PAL Inc. v. PALEA (PAL),[31] the Court found that outright termination of an employee caught with a piece of lead is unjustified. Retaining the erring employee would not necessarily result in oppression or self-destruction on the employer's part.[32] Later, in Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. of the Philippines v. Lariosa (Firestone),[33] the Court upheld the employer's right to self-preservation when it sustained the validity of the dismissal of an employee because retaining him could, in the long run, endanger the viability of the company. The employee was entrusted with twenty wool flannel swabs for cleaning disks, but he only used four and kept the rest in his bag. The employee's act of dishonesty in handling company property and breach of trust are valid grounds for dismissal.[34] However, the Court explained in Gelmart Industries Phils., Inc. v. NLRC (Gelmart)[35] that its ruling in Firestone is not \"a limitation on the [State's right] to regulate or temper the [management's prerogative] to dismiss an erring employee. [Even if the employee and employer agreed upon some rules on dismissal, the State can still inquire] whether or not its rigid application would work too harshly on the employee.\"[36] The Court reiterated its ruling in Gelmart[37] and found that dismissing an employee caught with a container filled with used motor oil is improper. The Court considered the employee's clean record in 15 years of service, the minimal value of the used oil, and the employer's failure to reasonably establish that non-dismissal of the employee would work undue prejudice to the viability of their operation, or is patently inimical to the company's interest.\n\nSimilarly, in Caltex Refinery Employees Association vs. NLRC (Caltex),[38] the Court considered the employee's clean record in his 8 years of service, the minimal value of the property and its timely retrieval, and the employer's failure to show that \"retention [of the employee] in the service would work undue prejudice to the viability of [its] operations or is patently inimical to its interest, [in finding that] the penalty of dismissal x x x is [too] harsh and [unreasonable for an employee who was caught with a lighter fluid during inspection].\" The Court held \"that the preventive suspension x x x is a sufficient penalty for the misdemeanor.\"[39] But then, 15 years later, the Court held in Nagkakaisang Lakas ng Manggagawa sa Keihin (NLMK-OLALIA-KMU), et al. v. Keihin Philippines Corp. (Keihin),[40] that the dismissal of an employee who \"attempted to bring home [a] packing tape\"[41] for her personal use was proper. The Court did not apply its ruling in Caltex because the employee was not even in her second year of service when the incident occurred, and the company was already dealing with several cases of theft and vandalism of company and employees' property when the incident happened. Moreover, the employee's intent to benefit herself and defy the company's reminders against theft showed that it was not just an error of judgment but a deliberate act of stealing company property.[42] Then, in Holcim,[43] the Court considered another factor, i.e., the employee's position, in determining whether theft of scrap electrical wires warrants dismissal. The Court explained that dismissal is not commensurate with the employee's act, especially since the employee, a packhouse operator, does not occupy a position of trust and confidence.[44]\n\nThus, the following factors should be considered in determining whether theft of company property by an employee warrants the penalty of dismissal: (a) period of employment and existence of a derogatory record; (b) value of the property involved; (c) cost of damage to the employer; (d) effect on the viability of employer's operation or company's interest; and (e) employee's position.\n\nHere, Roberto had been in URC's employ for 18 years, and this is the first time that he had been involved in taking company property. The bottle of ethyl alcohol valued at P60.00 is very minimal. URC did not lose anything as the bottle was timely retrieved. Further, it was not shown that Roberto's retention would work undue prejudice to the viability of URC's operations, or is patently inimical to its interest. Neither does Roberto occupy a position of trust and confidence, the loss of which would justify his dismissal. Hence, the Court finds that the penalty of dismissal is not proportional with Roberto's misconduct. His preventive suspension was a sufficient penalty for the misdemeanor.[45]\n\nThe Court cannot apply its ruling in Reno Foods, Inc. and\/or Khu v. Nagkakaisaing Lakas ng Manggagawa (NLM)-Katipunan (Reno)[46] and Keihin, as URC proffers. In Holcim, the Court clarified that Reno is not applicable in determining whether theft of company property is a serious misconduct because the issue in Reno is the entitlement of the dismissed employee to separation pay—not whether her dismissal for taking six cans of Reno is valid.[47] Meanwhile, Keihin is inapplicable here because the dismissed employee, in that case, was not even in her second year of service when the incident occurred, and the company was already dealing with several cases of theft and vandalism when the incident happened.[48] Here, Roberto had a clean record for 18 years, and the circumstance that the company is dealing with incidents of theft and vandalism of both company and employees' property is absent. Thus, the Court's ruling in Caltex is more apt.\n\nLikewise, URC's argument that the compromise agreement bars Roberto from filing an illegal dismissal case is unconvincing. Paragraph 2 of the compromise agreement reads:\n\n2. In view of the foregoing, the FIRST PARTY (the Company) and the SECOND PARTY (the petitioner) hereby release, waive and relinquish any and all other claim(s) or cause(s) of action that they may have against one another that arose or may arise relative to the crime of theft which is the subject of [this] criminal case.[49] (Underscoring supplied)\n\nClearly, the Waiver of Claims or other causes of action in the compromise agreement pertains to those that may arise from the crime of theft. Whether Roberto's misconduct is serious to justify his termination under the Labor Code is a different matter.\n\nIn fine, Roberto's misconduct is not serious to constitute a just cause for dismissal under Article 297 [282] of the Labor Code. Neither does Roberto hold a position of trust and confidence, which could justify his dismissal based on loss of trust. Therefore, Roberto was illegally dismissed.\n\nAn illegally dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement or separation pay if reinstatement is not viable. The award of separation pay is a mere exception.[50] The Court allows separation pay in lieu of reinstatement when reinstatement is no longer feasible, i.e., when the dismissed employee opts not to be reinstated.[51] Payment of separation pay is also allowed when there are strained relations between the employer and employee, which must be demonstrated and adequately supported by substantial evidence. It cannot be based on impression alone.[52]\n\nIn this case, the CA awarded separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, but there is no compelling evidence that reinstatement is impracticable. We reiterate that the filing of criminal and illegal dismissal cases between the parties does not automatically result in strained relations, rendering the reinstatement impossible. At any rate, the Court sustains the award of separation pay since reinstatement is no longer feasible. In his comment, Roberto prayed that the CA's decision awarding separation pay in his favor be affirmed. He is no longer interested in being reinstated to his former position.\n\nAn illegally dismissed employee is also entitled to backwages. However, backwages may not be awarded to an illegally dismissed employee if dismissal is too harsh of a penalty and the employer terminated the employment in good faith.[53] Such is the case here. Certainly, Roberto violated the company rules when he took a bottle of ethyl alcohol. But then, the penalty of dismissal is not commensurate to his infraction. As the Court held in Caltex, preventive suspension, not to mention Roberto's imprisonment, is a sufficient penalty for the misdemeanor. Believing that Roberto committed serious misconduct under the Labor Code, URC acted in good faith in dismissing him. For these reasons, Roberto is not entitled to backwages.\n\nLastly, Roberto is not entitled to attorney's fees. Invariably, the Court has held that attorney's fees \"may be awarded [to] employees [who were] illegally dismissed in bad faith and is compelled to litigate or incur expenses to protect [their] rights[.]\"[54] Considering that Roberto was not dismissed in bad faith, the Court cannot sustain the award of attorney's fees.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated September 15, 2020 and Resolution dated February 8, 2021 in CA-G.R. SP No. 155421 are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the award of backwages and attorney's fees are DELETED.

{"id":11,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 241837, January 05, 2022 ]\nREYMUNDO MASIL Y AVIAR, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\nINTING, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] filed by Reymundo Masil y Aviar (petitioner) assailing the Decision[2] dated June 13, 2018 and the Resolution[3] dated August 17, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 40074. The CA affirmed the Judgment[4] dated June 2, 2017 of Branch 123, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Caloocan City in Criminal Case No. C-84595 that convicted petitioner of the offense of Fencing, as defined and penalized under Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1612,[5] or the Anti-Fencing Law of 1979.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nIn an Information dated July 12, 2010, petitioner, along with a certain Wilfredo Santiago y Bontiago* (Wilfredo), was charged with the offense of Fencing, the accusatory portion of which reads:\nThat on or about the 10th day of July, 2007 in Caloocan City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, with accused Wilfredo Santiago y Bontiago, have in his possession one (1) unit of utility vehicle with Plate Number NYE-443 worth Php400,000.00 and acting as seller, sell and delivered to Reymundo Masil y Aviar, owner of AE Junkshop the following spare parts of said vehicle as follows:\n4-D-5\t\nPhp5,000.00\n \nInjection pump\t\n8,000.00\n \nFan Blade\t\n\n \nRocker Arm\t\n4,000.00\n \nAir Breaker\t\n500.00\n \n \t\nxxxxxxxxxxxx\n \n \t\nPhp17,500.00\n \nowned by NIMFA ESTEBAN y NICOLAS, in the amount of Php17,500.00 said accused knowing that said vehicle is of dubious origin or has been derived from proceeds of the crime of carnapping, to the damage and prejudice of the latter.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.[6]\nWhen arraigned, both petitioner and co-accused Wilfredo pleaded not guilty to the offense charged in the Information.[7]\n\nTrial ensued.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Nimfa N. Esteban (Nimfa) manages a passenger jeepney with Plate Number NYE-443 owned by her sister, Elizabeth Eustaquio. On July 4, 2010, she hired Eugene Labramonte (Eugene) as driver. On the scheduled date, Eugene took the jeepney from her residence to take passengers from Baclaran to Blumentritt. They agreed that the return of the jeepney will be at 10:00 p.m. However, Eugene failed to return the jeepney at the agreed time. Nimfa looked for Eugene but to no avail. The next day, she reported the theft of the jeepney to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Anti-Carnapping Unit in Caloocan City. She also went to the Highway Patrol Group, PNP Headquarters, Camp Crame, Quezon City to report the incident.[8]\n\nOn July 9, 2010, Nimfa received a call from a concerned citizen telling her that a vehicle was seen being dismantled in Brgy. 180, Caloocan City. The report led to the apprehension of Wilfredo, who was caught in the act of dismantling the jeepney at a junk shop in Little Baguio, Caloocan City.[9] When confronted by the police officers, Wilfredo denied knowing Eugene but admitted that the other parts of the dismantled jeepney had already been sold to a junk shop owned by petitioner.[10]\n\nMeanwhile, a barangay tanod tipped off Police Officer II Cesar Garcia (PO2 Garcia) that Eugene was detained in the barangay hall. Thereat, PO2 Garcia apprehended Eugene. Based on Eugene's admission, he sold the missing jeepney parts to AE Junk Shop owned by petitioner.[11]\n\nWith Wilfredo, the police officers proceeded to petitioner's junk shop where they saw and recovered the dismantled parts of the jeepney previously marked by Nimfa's husband, to wit: \"the D-5, injection pump, fan blade, rocker arm, and air breather.\"[12] As the stolen items were recovered from the possession of petitioner, the police officers charged petitioner and Wilfredo with violation of PD 1612.\n\nOn the other hand, petitioner denied knowing Wilfredo. He argued that he came to know his co-accused and the complainants only on July 11, 2010 at the police station. Nevertheless, he admitted that he was engaged in a junk shop business since June 2010; and he had been purchasing motor vehicle parts.[13]\n\nThe RTC Ruling\n\nIn the Judgment[14] dated June 2, 2017, the RTC found petitioner and Wilfredo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged. It sentenced them to suffer the indeterminate penalty of five (5) years and three (3) months of prision correccional in its maximum period, as minimum, to six (6) years and eight (8) months of prision mayor in its minimum period, as maximum.[15]\n\nThe RTC found that the prosecution successfully established the presence of all the elements of the offense of Fencing. It noted that: (1) the police officers caught Wilfredo red-handed dismantling the lost jeepney; (2) Wilfredo later volunteered the information that he sold some of the dismantled parts to petitioner; and (3) Wilfredo led the police officers to petitioner's junk shop where the dismantled parts were recovered.[16] It gave more weight to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses over the unsubstantiated denials of petitioner and Wilfredo.[17]\n\nAggrieved, petitioner appealed to the CA.\n\nThe CA Ruling\n\nIn the Decision[18] dated June 13, 2018, the CA affirmed petitioner's conviction. It held that the storage of the dismantled parts of the jeepney in petitioner's junk shop manifested intent to gain on the part of petitioner who was engaged in the junk shop business.[19] Thus:\nAppellant's defense, which is essentially premised on mere denial, cannot be accorded probative weight, especially so when taken in the light of the superior positive evidence of the prosecution (a) that accused Wilfredo was caught red-handed actually dismantling the subject jeepney; (b) that upon being apprehended by the police officers, he admitted having sold some parts of the jeepney to appellant; (c) that accused Wilfredo led the police officers to appellant's junk shop; and (d) that the dismantled parts of the vehicle were recovered from the junk shop of appellant.\n\nTime and again, the Supreme Court ruled that positive identification, where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill-motive on the part of the eyewitnesses testifying on the matter, prevails over alibi and denial which, if not substantiated by clear and convincing proof, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law. Worth-emphasizing is the fact that appellant did not present any evidence to show that the prosecution witnesses, in testifying against him, had ill-motive.\n\nx x x x\n\nIn this case, the corroborating declarations of private complainant and the police witnesses before the court a quo were categorical and straight-forward. Accordingly, a finding on the credibility of witnesses, as here, with respect to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses deserves a high degree of respect. There being no clear showing that the court a quo had overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could reverse a judgment of conviction, its findings stand.[20]\nUndaunted, petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied the motion in a Resolution[21] dated August 17, 2018.\n\nHence, the instant petition.\n\nThe Issue\n\nThe issue for the Court's resolution is whether the CA correctly upheld petitioner's conviction for the offense of Fencing, defined and penalized under PD 1612, or the Anti-Fencing Law of 1979.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nFencing is defined under Section 2 of PD 1612 as \"as the act of any person who, with intent to gain for himself or for another, shall buy, receive, possess, keep, acquire, conceal, sell or dispose of, or shall buy and sell, or in any manner deal in any article, item, object or anything of value which he knows, or should be known to him, to have been derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or theft.\"[22]\n\nThe following are the essential elements of the crime of fencing: (a) a crime of robbery or theft has been committed; (b) the accused, who is not a principal or an accomplice in the commission of the crime of robbery or theft, buys, receives, possesses, keeps, acquires, conceals, sells or disposes, or buys and sells, or in any manner deals in any article, item, object or anything of value, which has been derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or theft; (c) the accused knew or should have known that the said article, item, object or anything of value has been derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or theft; and (d) there is, on the part of the accused, an intent to gain for oneself or for another.[23]\n\nThe prosecution established the requisite quantum of evidence in proving beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the offense of Fencing.\n\nFirst, the evidence of the prosecution shows that, on July 4, 2010, the jeepney vehicle owned by Nimfa's sister was stolen by its driver who, in a separate case, was convicted of Qualified Theft.[24] Later, the police officers saw the lost jeepney being dismantled or cannibalized by petitioner's co-accused, Wilfredo.[25] Through the confession of Wilfredo, the police officers went to the junk shop of petitioner where they saw and recovered some of the dismantled parts of the jeepney.[26] The police officers were able to identify the dismantled parts through the markings placed thereon by Nimfa's husband.[27]\n\nSecond, petitioner never denied the fact that the missing parts of the lost jeepney were recovered from his junk shop, AE Junk Shop, in Caloocan City. He likewise admitted that he bought the dismantled parts from his co-accused, Wilfredo. He asserted that it was his wife who was first invited to the police station; but later on, he agreed to be held in her place and asserted that he was innocent of the charge.[28] Still the Court has consistently ruled in a number of cases that denial is a weak defense which cannot prevail over positive identification.[29]\n\nThird, circumstances exist to forewarn a reasonable vigilant buyer that the object of the sale may have been derived from the proceeds of robbery or theft. Such circumstance may include the time and place of the sale, the nature and condition of the goods sold, and the legality of source.[30]\n\nPetitioner knew or should have known that the articles, items, objects or anything of value had been derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or theft. The term \"should have known\" denotes that a person of reasonable prudence and intelligence ought to ascertain a fact in performance of his duty to another or govern his conduct upon the assumption that such fact exists.[31]\n\nPetitioner, a junk shop owner since 2010, ought to have known the requisites and the protocols in buying or selling motor vehicle parts. Specifically, Section 6 of PD 1612 requires stores, establishments, or entities dealing in the buying and selling of any good, article, item, object or anything else of value obtained from an unlicensed dealer or supplier thereof to secure the necessary clearance or permit from the station commander of the Integrated National Police[32] in the town or city where that store, establishment or entity is located before offering the item for sale to the public.[33] Lamentably for petitioner, he failed to adduce evidence that in buying from Wilfredo, he asked for any proof of ownership of the jeepney parts. Had petitioner done so, his experience from the business would have given him doubt as to the legitimate ownership or source thereof.\n\nFinally, fencing is malum prohibitum. Consequently, PD 1612 creates a prima facie presumption of fencing from evidence of possession by the accused of any good, article, item, object, or anything of value, which has been the subject of robbery or theft; and prescribes a higher penalty based on the value of the property.[34] In short, the law does not require proof of purchase of the stolen articles, as mere possession thereof is enough to give rise to a presumption of fencing.[35]\n\nIn the end, the Court finds no reason to deviate from the factual findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, considering that there is no indication that it overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. In fact, the RTC was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties; hence, due deference should be accorded to it.[36]\n\nAs to the penalty imposed by the RTC, the Court modifies it.\n\nUnder Section 3(a) of PD 1612, the penalty for Fencing is prision mayor if the value of the property involved is more than P12,000.00 but not exceeding P22,000.00, thus:\nSECTION 3. Penalties. — Any person guilty of fencing shall be punished as hereunder indicated:\n\na) The penalty of prision mayor, if the value of the property involved is more than 12,000 pesos but not exceeding 22,000 pesos; if the value of such property exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos; but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, the penalty shall be termed reclusion temporal and the accessory penalty pertaining thereto provided in the Revised Penal Code shall also be imposed.\nWhile the offense of Fencing is defined and penalized by PD 1612, a special penal law, the penalty provided therein is taken from the nomenclature in the Revised Penal Code (RPC).[37] In Peralta v. People,[38] the Court judiciously discussed the proper treatment of penalties found in special penal laws vis-à-vis Act No. 4103, viz.:\nMeanwhile, Sec. 1 of Act No. 4103, otherwise known as the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL), provides that if the offense is ostensibly punished under a special law, the minimum and maximum prison term of the indeterminate sentence shall not be beyond what the special law prescribed. Be that as it may, the Court had clarified in the landmark ruling of People v. Simon that the situation is different where although the offense is defined in a special law, the penalty therefore is taken from the technical nomenclature in the RPC. Under such circumstance, the legal effects under the system of penalties native to the Code would also necessarily apply to the special law.[39]\nEvidently, if the special penal law adopts the nomenclature of the penalties under the RPC, the ascertainment of the indeterminate sentence will be based on the rules defined under the RPC.[40] Given that the value of the property involved in this case is P17,500.00, the penalty to be imposed is prision mayor in its medium period, which ranges from eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years.\n\nApplying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances present in the case, the penalty of prision mayor in its medium period shall be imposed in its medium period, which is eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to nine (9) years and four (4) months. Thus, the minimum term to be imposed is the penalty next lower in degree which is prision mayor in its minimum period which has a duration of six (6) years and one (1) day to eight (8) years. On the other hand, the maximum term shall be taken within the medium period of prision mayor in its medium period which has a duration of eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to nine (9) years and four (4) months. Hence, the Court finds it proper to sentence petitioner to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of six (6) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of prision mayor in its minimum period, as minimum, to eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of prision mayor in its medium period, as maximum.\n\nLastly, the Court reiterates its observation in Estrella v. People[41] regarding the enactment of Republic Act No. 10951[42] adjusting the values of the property and damage on which the various penalties under the RPC are based, thus:\n[T]he Court notes the recent enactment of Republic Act No. (RA) 10951 which adjusted the values of the property and damage on which various penalties are based, taking into consideration the present value or money as compared to its value way back in 1932 when the RPC was enacted. RA 10951 substantially amended the penalties prescribed for Theft under Article 309 of the RPC without concomitant adjustment for the offense of Fencing under PD 1612.\n\nThe Court is not unaware that the recent development would then result on instances where a Fence, which is theoretically a mere accessory to the crime of Robbery\/Theft, will be punished more severely than the principal of such latter crimes. However, as can be clearly gleaned in RA 10951, the adjustment is applicable only to the crimes defined under the RPC and not under special penal laws such as PD 1612. The Court remains mindful of the fact that the determination of penalties is a policy matter that belongs to the legislative branch of the government which is beyond the ambit of judicial powers. Thus, this Court can not adjust the penalty to be imposed against the petitioner based on RA 10951 considering that the offense of Fencing is defined under PD 1612, a special penal law.\n\nThe Court already furnished the Houses of Congress, as well as the President of the Philippines, through the Department of Justice, copies of the case of Cahulogan v.

{"id":12,"text":"EN BANC\n[ OCA IPI No. 20-5005-P, November 29, 2022 ]\nJOEL AGULTO SAGUM, COMPLAINANT, VS. JONELL C. CASTILLO,* CLERK, (LOCALLY FUNDED EMPLOYEE), BRANCH 89, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BACOOR CITY, CAVITE, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nLOPEZ, J., J.:\n\nA person who purports to be a judicial employee or claims to have an influence in the outcome of a case should be subject to contempt proceedings.\nThis Court resolves the administrative complaint filed by Joel A. Sagum (Sagum) against Jenel C. Castillo (Castillo), a clerk at Branch 89, Regional Trial Court, Bacoor City, Cavite.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nSagum stated in his Sinumpaang Salaysay[1] that he was the driver\/assistant of Mary Ann B. Ramos-Castro (Castro). He averred that sometime in June 2019, Castillo invited Castro and him to join Castillo in one of the rooms. Sagum heard Castillo saying, \"Wag kang mag-alala, ako na ang bahala diyan. Mahahatulan na iyan.\" He witnessed Castro handing money to Castillo as they stepped out of the room.[2]\n\nSagum further avowed that another incident occurred in July 2019 wherein Castillo told him, \"Nasan 'yung para sa akin? Paano 'yung pang-ayos natin sa mga piskal[?]\" He replied, \"Wala. Kayo naman ang magkausap diyan, siya na lang ang tanungin mo.\"[3]\n\nCastillo, in his Kontra Salaysay,[4] claimed that the Office of the Court Administrator had no jurisdiction over the complaint because he was a casual messenger of the local government unit of Bacoor City, and not an office clerk of the Regional Trial Court. Castillo also vehemently denied the allegations of Sagum and claimed that the allegations were meant to malign his integrity and the office he was associated with.[5]\n\nThe Office of the Court Administrator referred the complaint to the Judiciary Integrity Board after it received the pleadings of the parties.[6]\n\nThe Judiciary Integrity Board dismissed the complaint based on its assessment that it lacks jurisdiction over the person of Castillo. It noted the letter[7] dated November 25, 2021 of the Legal Office, Office of the Court Administrator-Office of Administrative Services, which confirmed that per its records, \"no approved detail order of locally-funded employee was issued by this Court to Mr. Castillo at Branch 89, Regional Trial Court, Bacoor City, Cavite.\"[8]\n\nIssue\n\nWhether or not Castillo should be held administratively liable for his acts.\n\nThis Court's Ruling\n\nThis Court adopts the recommendation of the Judiciary Integrity Board with modifications.\n\nThe certifications of the Office of the Court Administrator-Office of Administrative Services and the Human Resources Development and Management Department of Bacoor City, Cavite[9] clearly proves that Castillo is not an employee of the Judiciary particularly of the Bacoor City Regional Trial Court. Thus, the Judiciary Integrity Board correctly recommended the dismissal of the Complaint. Rule III, Section 1 of the Internal Rules of the Judiciary Integrity Board[10] provides:\n\nSECTION 1. Jurisdiction. — The Judiciary Integrity Board shall exercise jurisdiction over administrative complaints or referrals against the following:\n\nPresiding Justices and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Tax Appeals, and the Shari'ah High Court and Judges of the lower courts, including Shari'ah District or Circuit Courts, and the officials and employees of the Judiciary, Court Administrator, Deputy Court Administrators, Assistant Court Administrators and their personnel; and\n\nCourt officials and employees involving violations of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel and\/or the Civil Service Laws and Rules.\nNonetheless, even if the Judiciary Integrity Board and this Court has no jurisdiction to discipline the alleged infractions committed by Castillo, We deem it proper to refer the investigation to the officials of the local government unit of Bacoor City. Further, this Court orders the commencement of contempt proceedings against Castillo and a determination of being barred from future employment in the judiciary. This Court echoes our pronouncement in Anonymous Complaint against Clerk of Court V Atty. Zenalfe M. Cuenca, et. al.[11] as follows:\n\nAs for [Aleli] De Guzman, the Court sustains the OCA's findings that she violated reasonable office rules and regulations for using the court computer and printer to prepare and print pleadings for the litigants. The records disclose that in a Memorandum dated June 8, 2010, Atty. Caridad A. Pabello, OCA Chief of Office, Office of Administrative Services, confirmed that the Court did not approve De Guzman's detail. In a Resolution dated July 21, 2010, the Court ordered De Guzman to return to her mother unit. In her Comment dated August 19, 2010, De Guzman stated that she was no longer connected with the Malabon RTC, Branch 72 and any other government institution as she purportedly resigned.\n\nWhile De Guzman was never an employee of the Court, still she committed violations of the court's reasonable office rules and regulations when she used the court computer and printer to prepare and print pleadings for the litigants. Her actions may be considered as improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice, thus, a ground for indirect contempt. While the Court cannot exercise administrative supervision over her since, based on the records, her detail to the said RTC was not even approved, therefore, she is not a court employee, still she must be held accountable for her acts of disrespect towards the Judiciary. Also, since according to De Guzman she is no longer connected with any government institution, a recommendation of referral to the local government unit would not serve any practical purpose. For this reason, the Court deems it proper to refer De Guzman's case to the Presiding Judge of Malabon RTC, Branch 72 and direct said Judge to commence contempt proceedings against De Guzman. The findings in this administrative case may be taken cognizance of by said court in the contempt proceedings.\n\nIn the aforementioned case, while Aleli De Guzman (De Guzman) was supposed to be a locally funded-employee, the lack of approval of this Court did not make her an employee of the court to which she was purportedly assigned. Despite this, her acts in the trial court reflected on the impression of the public in the administration of justice, thereby authorizing the commencement of contempt proceedings. As further elaborated by Senior Associate Justice Marvic Leonen in his Separate Concurring Opinion:\n\nFrom Judge Laurea's Report, De Guzman was purportedly in cahoots with other court employees in making money out of cases filed before Branch 72. Even without a duly approved assignment, De Guzman seemingly acted as a court personnel, which, in my mind, was a means to lure litigants into paying for a consideration in exchange for unwarranted favors and benefits such as \"favorable or speedy actions and early settings\" of their cases. Apart from this, it was discovered that De Guzman also took part in causing the arrest of accused in archived cases \"who would later be released after payment of consideration.\"\n\nAlthough further surveillance was recommended to adduce evidence for the above findings, it is my view that De Guzman's transgressions should, as a matter of course, be dealt with accordingly. Considering that the image of a court is reflected in the official and personal conduct of its employees, she should be made liable for her misrepresentation that not only degrades the administration of justice, but also erodes the people's confidence to the courts.[12]\n\nThe case of De Guzman is not far removed from the instant case wherein Castillo expressly gave representations of being able to influence a judge in a case. While he is not an employee of the court, his representation reflected on the manner of administering justice. He even used such representation to be able to extort money from other people. His act constituted a transgression of his duties, being a mere casual employee of the local government unit. Judicial notice must be taken that most of the courts are housed in the same building where offices of the local government units are likewise located. Hence, it is not easy for ordinary people to distinguish employees of the judiciary from employees of the local government unit. They could only rely on the representation of people they encounter. This Court, having emphasized not only impartiality but also the appearance of impartiality in the rendition of justice, cannot just let any person betray the trust reposed upon by the people in the judiciary. As held in Rallos v. Judge Gako: [13]\n\nWell-known is the judicial norm that \"judges should not only be impartial but should also appear impartial.\" Jurisprudence repeatedly teaches that litigants are entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge. The other elements of due process, like notice and hearing, would become meaningless if the ultimate decision is rendered by a partial or biased judge. Judges must not only render just, correct and impartial decisions, but must do so in a manner free of any suspicion as to their fairness, impartiality and integrity.[14]\n\nThis Court must not let any person, be the employee or not of the judiciary, to tarnish judicial norms that this Court has sought to establish and preserve. Appropriate measures must be taken to protect the institution.\n\nWith this, this Court orders the Presiding Judge of the Bacoor City Regional Trial Court to refer the administrative complaint filed by Sagum to the proper office in the local government of Bacoor City. This Court further commands the Presiding Judge of the Bacoor City Regional Trial Court to commence contempt proceedings against Castillo or a determination of being barred from future employment in the Judiciary.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Report and Recommendation of the Judicial Integrity Board dated April 20, 2022 is ADOPTED WITH MODIFICATIONS. This Court resolves to ADOPT and APPROVE the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the Acting Executive Director in its Report and Recommendation dated February 2, 2022, which the Judicial Integrity Board likewise adopted and approved. The administrative complaint against Jonell C. Castillo, also known as Jenel C. Castillo, is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction over the person of the respondent.\n\nFurther, this Court ORDERS the Presiding Judge of Branch 89, Regional Trial Court, Bacoor City to REFER the administrative complaint filed by Joel Agulto Sagum to the proper office in the local government unit of Bacoor City. Furthermore, this Court COMMANDS the Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court Bacoor City to COMMENCE contempt proceedings or a determination of being barred from future employment in the Judiciary against Jenel C. Castillo also known as Jonell Castillo.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nGesmundo, C.J., Leonen, SAJ., Caguioa, Hernando, Lazaro-Javier, Inting, Zalameda, M.

{"id":13,"text":"EN BANC\n[ G.R. No. 251824, November 29, 2022 ]\nPETER B. FAVILA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nHERNANDO, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] filed under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Rules of Court assailing the January 30, 2019 Decision[2] and the January 29, 2020 Resolution[3] of respondent Commission on Audit (COA).\n\nFactual Antecedents\n\nDuring the period from 2008 to 2010, petitioner Peter B. Favila (Favila), who was then the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), served as an ex-officio member of the Board of Directors (Board\/BOD) of the Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines (TIDCORP),[4] a government corporate entity created under Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1080,[5] as amended by Republic Act No. (RA) 8494.[6]\n\nOn various occasions from 2005 to 2007, TIDCORP's BOD approved eight Board Resolutions approving the grant of productivity enhancement pay, developmental contribution bonuses, corporate guaranty, grocery subsidy, and anniversary bonuses to its board members and their alternates.[7]\n\nOn July 13, 2012, without a prior notice of suspension, COA Audit Team Leader Gloria O. Lacson (ATL Lacson) and Supervising Auditor Teodora M. Lacerna (SA Lacerna) issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2012-001,[8] disallowing various disbursement vouchers and the corresponding checks in the total amount of PHP 4,539,835.02, pertaining to monetary benefits of TIDCORP's Board members for the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, on the ground that the same were not in accordance with Section 8, Article IX-B of the 1987 Philippine Constitution,[9] which pertinently reads:\n8. No elective or appointive public officer or employee shall receive additional, double, or indirect compensation, unless specifically authorized by law, x x x.\nIt was opined that the disallowed amount constitutes double compensation since the Board members received the same in an ex-officio capacity. One of the members held liable under the ND was herein petitioner Favila who allegedly received a total of PHP 454,598.28 in benefits from October 2008 to May 2010.[10]\n\nTIDCORP, on behalf of its implicated officers, appealed the disallowance to the Office of the Cluster Director arguing that Sec. 7[11] of RA 8494 expressly grants to the Board the exclusive power to fix the remuneration, emoluments, and fringe benefits of TIDCORP officers and employees. By virtue of this, the Board passed the resolutions granting the questioned monetary benefits to its members in good faith. TIDCORP further averred that COA denied the Board members of their right to due process when it proceeded with the disallowance without first issuing a Notice of Suspension.[12]\n\nIn their Answer Memorandum, ATL Lacson and SA Lacerna argued that Sec. 7 of RA 8494 pertains to the authority of the Board to grant benefits\/bonuses to the officers and employees of TIDCORP, and not to those given to the Board of Directors, much more to its ex-officio members. Sec. 13 of RA 8494 limits the benefits that may be accorded to the members of the Board to per diem allowances only.[13]\n\nRuling of the Corporate Government Sector\n\nIn a Decision[14] dated October 8, 2015, the COA Corporate Government Sector (CGS) affirmed the ND and denied the appeal for lack of merit. Citing the Court's ruling in Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary (Civil Liberties Union),[15] the COA-CGS held that the members of the TIDCORP's Board who held their positions in ex-officio capacity had no right to receive additional compensation since their compensation were already paid by their respective principal offices to which they were attached.[16] According to the COA-CGS, Sec. 13 of PD 1080 merely authorizes the grant of a per diem of P500.00 only to TIDCORP's Board members for every Board meeting attended. There is nothing in the law that allows TIDCORP's BOD to receive other benefits besides the per diem.\n\nThe COA-CGS also found that the Board failed to comply with Memorandum Order No. (MO) 20, series of 2001, which requires the prior approval of the President before any increase in benefits could take effect.[17] Since the benefits and allowances received by the members of the Board were contrary to law, the same should be returned to the government, otherwise, the payees thereof would be guilty of unjust enrichment. Finally, the COA-CGS rejected TIDCORP's claim that the Board members were denied due process of law holding that they were afforded an opportunity to be heard through their Appeal Memorandum.[18]\n\nThe decretal portion of the COA-CGS Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, this Office DENIES the instant appeal for lack of merit. Accordingly, the Notice of Disallowance No. 2012-001 dated 13 July 2012, issued by the Office of the Supervising Auditor of TIDCORP is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\nSo ordered.[19]\nRuling of the Commission on Audit Proper\n\nNot satisfied with the COA-CGS' disposition, TIDCORP instituted a Petition for Review[20] before the Commission proper but the same was denied in its assailed Decision No. 2019-001[21] dated January 13, 2019. The COA upheld the finding of the COA-CGS that members of the Board who were sitting in their ex-officio capacity and their alternates were not entitled to receive any additional compensation since their compensation were already paid by their respective offices to which they were attached.\n\nIt further noted that the petition was filed beyond the 180 days to file an appeal under Sec. 48 of PD 1445 and Sec. 3, Rule VII of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the COA. Consequently, the assailed COA-CGS Decision has already become final and executory pursuant to Sec. 51 of PD 1445. The dispositive portion thereof reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review of the Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. Accordingly, Commission on Audit Corporate Government Sector-Cluster 2 Decision No. 2015-021 dated October 7, 2015, which affirmed Notice of Disallowance No. 2012-001 dated July 13, 2012, relative to the grant of benefits to ex-officio members of the Board of Directors and their alternates, for the period of January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, in the aggregate amount of P4,539,835.02, is AFFIRMED.[27]\nThe separate Motions for Reconsideration filed by herein petitioner Favila and his co-respondents, Armando Suratos, et. al., were likewise denied by the COA in its Resolution No. 2020-177[28] dated January 29, 2020.\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nAt the outset, it is apt to mention that Favila's co-respondents, Armando Suratos, et. al. have already challenged COA Decision No. 2019-001 and Resolution No. 2020-177 in a Petition for Review filed with this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 253584, entitled \"Armando L. Suratos, Amando M. Tetangco, Jr., Alberto V. Reyes, and Nestor A. Espenilla, Jr., as represented by his estate vs. Commission on Audit,\" (Suratos).[29] The petition was, however, dismissed by the Court en banc in a Resolution dated March 1, 2022. The Court affirmed the assailed COA Decision and Resolution and accordingly held Suratos, et. al. solidarily liable as approving officers and recipients of the disallowed amount. Consequently, they were ordered to restitute to the government the amount of PHP 4,539,835.02 immediately.\n\nHere, We point out that Favila similarly anchors his petition on the same grounds and arguments relied upon by Suratos, et. al. which were already judiciously passed upon by the Court in Suratos. Favila maintains that: 1) he is entitled to the benefits given to him as the same were granted pursuant to duly issued Board Resolutions and in accordance with the TIDCORP Charter; 2) he received the disallowed amount in good faith, as such he cannot be ordered to refund the same and; 3) the disputed ND was issued in violation of his right to procedural due process.[30]\n\nIn its Comment[31] dated November 26, 2020, COA avers that: 1) it did not commit grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed Favila's appeal for having been filed out of time; 2) it did not violate Favila's right to procedural due process; 3) the assailed Decision is in consonance with prevailing laws and jurisprudence; and 4) Favila benefited from the unlawful grant of the disallowed allowance, and should therefore, refund the amount he received.[32]\n\nIssue\n\nWhether the COA acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying Favila's petition for review and affirming ND No. 2012-001.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nThe petition lacks merit.\n\nGiven the Court's disposition in Suratos, the appropriate course of action is to dismiss the instant petition of Favila conformably with the Suratos ruling.\n\nThe petition offered no new argument as regards the legality of the subject allowances. In Suratos, We held that Suratos, et. al. were not entitled to the disallowed benefits since PD 1080 only specifically authorized the payment of per diem to TIDCORP's Board members. Further, Suratos, et. al. had no right to receive additional compensation or benefits as mere ex-officio members of the Board considering that their services were already paid for and covered by the compensation attached to their principal office.\n\nApplying Our ruling in Suratos here, the Court upholds the finding of COA that Favila's right to compensation as member of the TIDCORP Board in an ex-officio capacity is limited only to per diem authorized by law and no other. This is in line with the Court's ruling in Land Bank of the Philippines v. Commission on Audit,[33] where We similarly dismissed Land Bank's Board of Directors' claim for additional compensation, holding that they were not entitled thereto since their ex-officio position is in legal contemplation part of their principal office. Further, the Court found that the Land Bank Charter does not authorize the grant of additional allowances to the Board members, viz.:\nThe LBP Charter – R.A. No. 3844, as amended by R.A. No. 7907, does not authorize the grant of additional allowances to the Board of Directors beyond per diems. Specifically, Section 86 of R.A. No. 3844, as amended, provides for the entitlement of the Chairman and the Members of the Board of Directors to a per diem of P1,500.00 for each Board meeting attended, but the same must not exceed P7,500.00 every month. Significantly, the LBP Charter provides for nothing more than per diems, to which regular\/appointive Members of the Board of Directors are entitled to for each Board session.[34]\nIn the same vein, there is nothing in the TIDCORP's Charter – PD 1080 that permits the grant of extra compensation to its BOD and their respective alternates besides a per diem of PHP 500.00 for every board meeting attended. As such, any form of compensation beyond what is provided in Sec. 13[35] of PD 1080 is considered illegal, and in contravention of the constitutional prohibitions against holding multiple positions in the government and receiving additional or double compensation.\n\nAnent Favila's contention that his right to due process was violated, the Court has already declared in Suratos that the repeated opportunity given to Suratos, et. al. to argue their case before the COA and this Court has sufficiently satisfied the essence of due process which is the fair and reasonable opportunity to be heard or to explain one's side. In Saligumba v. Commission on Audit,[36] We held that \"[d]ue process is satisfied when a person is notified of the charge against him and given an opportunity to explain or defend himself.\" Here, it is undisputed that Favila actively participated in the proceedings before the COA. In fact, he even sought a reconsideration of the adverse ruling against him. Verily, the requirements of administrative due process were satisfied in the proceedings before the COA, and finally, in this Court.\n\nLastly, We reject Favila's good faith defense as an excuse from returning the disallowed amount. As early as 1991 in the case of Civil Liberties Union,[37] the Court has already settled that ex-officio members in government agencies are prohibited from receiving additional compensation. In this case, Favila cannot claim that he was not properly informed of the illegality of the disallowed benefits because there were already prevailing jurisprudence disallowing allowances of the same nature. Thus, the existence of the Court's rulings on the matter militates against his claim of good faith.\n\nFurther, as held by the Court in Suratos, Suratos, et. al. were not mere passive recipients of the disallowed amount considering that they participated in the approval thereof through resolutions passed by the TIDCORP Board. Worse, the said Board resolutions were passed without the President's approval contrary to Sec. 3[38] of MO 20.[39]\n\nIn fine, without the prior approval of the President and being in clear circumvention of law and the Constitution, the questioned allowances are deemed illegal.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED. The Decision No. 2019-001 dated January 30, 2019 and the Resolution No. 2020-177 dated January 29, 2020 of the Commission on Audit are hereby AFFIRMED. Peter B. Favila is held solidarity liable as approving officer and recipient of the disallowed amount, and is directed to settle the said amount of PHP 4,539,835.02 immediately.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nGesmundo, C.J., Leonen, SAJ., Caguioa, Lazaro-Javier, Inting, Zalameda, M.

{"id":146,"text":"THIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 252715, October 12, 2022 ]\nJOEL G. NOLASCO, PETITIONER, VS. PURENCE REALTY CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nGAERLAN, J.:\n\nThis is a petition for review on certiorari[1] filed by Joel G. Nolasco (Nolasco) assailing the Resolutions dated August 30, 2019[2] and June 10, 2020[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 112755. The CA dismissed the appeal of Nolasco due to his failure to timely file an appellant's brief.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Purence Realty Corporation (Purence) filed an action for recovery of posession and quieting of title with damages against Nolasco and Elizardo Francisco (Francisco) (collectively, defendants) in the RTC of Biñan, Laguna. The case was initially raffled to Branch 25 but was transferred to Branch 102 of the RTC of Santa Rosa, Laguna pursuant to Supreme Court Administrative Order No. 53-2017. Purence alleged that it is the absolute owner of the lots covered by Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) Nos. 131670 and 131671 at Don Jose Zavalla Subdivision in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. Sometime in 1990, it discovered that the defendants illegally entered and occupied the properties through stealth and strategy and without its consent. In March 2004, the defendants filed a complaint against Purence before the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) - Regional Field Office No. IV claiming that Nolasco acquired the properties from spouses Celso and Apolonia Dichoso (spouses Dischoso); while Francisco purchased the lot from Roberto Nolasco (Roberto). The HLURB found that the defendants do not have a cause of action against Purence for lack of privity of contract. On appeal, the HLURB Board of Commissioners affirmed the ruling. By virtue of this decision, Purence sent demand letters to the defendants for them to vacate the properties, but they refused causing the filing of the case.[4]\n\nOnly Nolasco was successfully served with summons. However, he failed to file his answer to the complaint, prompting Purence to file a motion to declare him in default. Nolasco subsequently filed his answer. He claimed that his parents, Roberto and Flaviana, bought the properties from spouses Dichoso, who in tum, purchased them from Purence. Roberto fully paid the properties with Purence as evidenced by an official receipt. A certification was also issued by Prescilla Lijauco and Pablo Cerdena stating that they have personal knowledge that Roberto had fully paid block 3, lot 14 to Purence. Purence opposed the admission of Nolasco's answer.\n\nIn its Resolution[5] dated May 8, 2018, the RTC declared Nolasco in default after finding that it took him more or less 87 days to file his answer. While Nolasco blamed his lapses on his sickness and ignorance, the RTC noted that he neither specified the said sickness nor attached a valid medical certificate to support his claim. Hence, Nolasco' s answer was stricken from the records and Purence was allowed to present its evidence ex-parte before the Branch Clerk of Court.[6]\n\nThe RTC's Ruling\n\nIn its Decision[7] dated November 12, 2018, the RTC ruled in favor of Purence, the fallo of which reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioner Purence Realty Corporation and against the respondent Joel Nolasco, as follows: \na.\t\nordering respondent Joel Nolasco and all persons claiming rights under him to vacate the subject premises and peacefully surrender possession thereof to petitioner;\n \t\nb.\t\nordering respondent Joel Nolasco and all persons claiming rights under him to demolish any and all structure built therein at their own cost;\n \t\nc.\t\nto pay the cost of suit.\n\nSO ORDERED.[8]\nThe RTC explained that the case filed is an accion publiciana or an ordinary civil proceeding to determine the better right of possession of a realty independent of title. However, when the parties raise the issue of ownership, the court may pass upon the said issue albeit provisionally.[9] The RTC found that Purence has a preferred claim of possession over Nolasco. The titles of the lots have been in the name of Purence since 1985. As the registered owner, Purence has a right to possess the properties, which is one of the attributes of ownership. Hence, it must be restored to its lawful possession pursuant to Article 539 of the New Civil Code. It has the right to eject Nolasco from the properties. As regards Francisco, no ruling can validly be made against him since he was neither served with summons nor did he voluntarily appeared and submitted himself to the authority of the court. The RTC held that it is no longer necessary to dwell on the issue of quieting of title. It also rejected Purence's prayer for attorney's fees for lack of merit.[10]\n\nNolasco filed an appeal to the CA.[11]\n\nThe CA's Ruling\n\nIn its Resolution[12] dated August 30, 2019, the CA considered the appeal abandoned and dismissed the case for Nolasco's failure to file an appellant's brief under Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Court. It noted that on May 8, 2019, Nolasco's counsel received a letter from the Judicial Records Division (JRD) requiring him to file an appellant's brief within 45 days from receipt thereof. Thus, Nolasco had until June 22, 2019 to file a brief or a motion for extension. However, it was only on July 8, 2019 or 16 days after the lapse of the reglementary period that he filed a motion for extension of 30 days from June 22, 2019 until July 22, 2019. On August 5, 2019 or 14 days after the expiration of the first extension, Nolasco asked for an additional period of five (5) days from July 22, 2019 until July 27, 2019 to file his appellant's brief. The CA observed that instead of filing an appellant's brief, Nolasco filed two motions for extension, which were both filed beyond the prescribed period.[13]\n\nNolasco filed a Motion for Reconsideration (With Motion to Admit Attached Brief for the Respondent-Appellant),[14] which the CA denied in its Resolution dated June 10, 2020. The CA opined that it is clear from the records that Nolasco's counsel received the letter of the JRD on May 8, 2019 as evidenced by the Registry Return Receipt. Nonetheless, he failed to file the appellant's brief within the prescribed period and his explanation for the same is not sufficiently compelling to warrant a reversal of the court's earlier Resolution.[15]\n\nThe CA explained that the Public Attorney's Office-Special and Appealed Cases Services (PAO-SACS) received two notices to file brief. One was on May 8, 2019 and the other was on May 22, 2019. Nolasco's counsel claimed that the May 8 notice might have been inadvertently inserted into the records of another case. The CA held that if this was the case, how about the May 22 notice? Counted from this date, Nolasco had until July 6, 2019 to file his brief. Yet as of August 30, 2019, no brief was filed. Proffered as a reason for the non-filing was the volume of pleadings for filing as well as other cases requiring urgent attention. The CA ruled that this is not compelling enough to reverse the dismissal of the case.[16]\n\nUndaunted, Nolasco filed the present petition. First, he argues that the CA erred in declaring his appeal abandoned despite the excusable circumstances surrounding its belated filing. He states that the work volume in the handling counsel's office is common knowledge. The appellant's brief was finalized on August 5, 2019 and was ready to be filed in court as well as served to the opposing party. Yet, due to inadvertence, it was not filed because of the other pleadings being worked on at the office. Proof of such innocent inadvertence is that the non-filing was only discovered upon receipt of the CA's first assailed Resolution.[17] Nolasco asks the Court to relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction.[18]\n\nSecond, Nolasco asserts that his appeal is meritorious. He alleges that the RTC has no jurisdiction over the case because the complaint did not specify the assessed value of the subject lots.[19] Further, Purence failed to prove its better right to possess the properties since it failed to identify their metes and bounds. There is a possibility that the properties sought to be recovered by Purence are not part of its Certificates of Title.[20] Nolasco maintains that the CA gravely misappreciated his plight. He seeks a chance to fight for his home based on substantial justice and not on mere technicalities.[21]\n\nIn its comment, Purence claims that the petition before the Court was filed out of time. It avers that the contumacious failure of Nolasco to abide by the Rules of Court justly and legally warranted the order of default and the dismissal of the case. Hence, it prays for the dismissal of the petition for lack of merit.[22]\n\nIn his reply, Nolasco contends that the petition was timely filed. He explained that a motion for extension of time to file petition was filed on July 16, 2020 praying for an extension of 30 days or until August 15, 2020 to file the petition. On August 3, 2020, in view of the imposition of the Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ), the Supreme Court issued Administrative Circular No. 43A-2020 suspending the reglementary period for filing of petitions from August 4, 2020 to August 18, 2020. Before the imposition of the suspension, Nolasco still had 12 remaining days to file the petition. The reglementary period was merely interrupted by the suspension. Hence, Nolasco had another 12 days from August 18, 2020 to August 30, 2020 to file the petition. However, August 30 fell on a Sunday. Therefore, the petition was seasonably filed on the next working day or on September 1, 2020.[23]\n\nIssue\n\nWhether the CA erred in dismissing Nolasco' s appeal.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe petition is partly meritorious.\n\nAt the outset, contrary to Purence's claim, We find that the petition was seasonably filed on September 1, 2020. Nolasco received the CA's Resolution[24] dated June 10, 2020 on July 1, 2020. Under Section 2, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, he has 15 days from notice of the said resolution, that is, until July 16, 2020 to file a petition for review or to file a motion for extension to file the same. On July 16, 2020, he filed a Motion for Extension of Time To File Petition For Review On Certiorari[25] asking for an extension of 30 days or until August 15, 2020 within which to file the petition. We granted the motion in Our Resolution[26] dated August 26, 2020.\n\nMeantime, Metro Manila, Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan, and Laguna were placed on MECQ from August 4 to 18, 2020. In response, on August 3, 2020, We issued Administrative Circular No. 43A-2020 suspending the reglementary periods for the filing of petitions, appeals, complaints, motions, pleadings, and other court submissions from August 4 to 18, 2020. The periods for court actions with prescribed periods were also suspended and resumed on August 19, 2020. When the reglementary period was suspended on August 4, 2020, Nolasco had 11 remaining days to file the petition. Thus, upon resumption on August 19, 2020, he also had 11 days or until August 30, 2020 to file the petition. August 30 fell on a Sunday, hence, the petition should be filed on the next working day, or on September 1, 2020.\n\nWe now proceed to the crux of the controversy. Pursuant to Section 1 (e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, the CA has the discretionary authority to dismiss an appeal for non-filing of an appellant's brief, to wit:\nSection 1. Grounds for dismissal of appeal. - An appeal may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:\n\nx x x x\n\n(e) Failure of the appellant to serve and file the required number of copies of his brief or memorandum within the time provided by these Rules[.]\nThe use of the permissive \"may\" in the wording of the above-stated provision meant that the dismissal of the appeal by the CA is directory and not mandatory. However, the CA's discretion must be exercised soundly and in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play having in mind the circumstances of each case.[27]\n\nIn National Grid Corporation of the Philippines v. Bautista[28] (National Grid), We used the following guidelines in determining whether to sustain the dismissal of the appeal by the CA for failure to file an appellant's brief, viz.:\nIn Beatingo v. Bu Gasis, the Court clarified the CA's discretionary power of dismissal of an appeal for failure to file Appellant's Brief in this wise:\nThe question of whether or not to sustain the dismissal of an appeal due to petitioner's failure to file the Appellant's Brief had been raised before this Court in a number of cases. In some of these cases, we relaxed the Rules and allowed the belated filing of the Appellant's Brief. In other cases, however, we applied the Rules strictly and considered the appeal abandoned, which thus resulted in its eventual dismissal. In Government of the Kingdom of Belgium v. Court of Appeals, we revisited the cases which we previously decided and laid down the following guidelines in confronting the issue of non-filing of the Appellant's Brief:\n\n(1) The general rule is for the Court of Appeals to dismiss an appeal when no appellant's brief is filed within the reglementary period prescribed by the rules;\n\n(2) The power conferred upon the Court of Appeals to dismiss an appeal is discretionary and directory and not ministerial or mandatory;\n\n(3) The failure of an appellant to file his brief within the reglementary period does not have the effect of causing the automatic dismissal of the appeal;\n\n(4) In case of late filing, the appellate court has the power to still allow the appeal; however, for the proper exercise of the court's leniency[,] it is imperative that:\n(a) the circumstances obtaining warrant the court's liberality;\n\n(b) that strong considerations of equity justify an exception to the procedural rule in the interest of substantial justice;\n\n(c) no material injury has been suffered by the appellee by the delay;\n\n(d) there is no contention that the appellee's cause was prejudiced;\n\n(e) at least there is no motion to dismiss filed.\n(5) In case of delay, the lapse must be for a reasonable period; and\n\n(6) Inadvertence of counsel cannot be considered as an adequate excuse as to call for the appellate court's indulgence except:\n(a) where the reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the client of due process of law;\n\n(b) when application of the rule will result in outright deprivation of the client's liberty or property; or\n\n(c) where the interests of justice so require.[29] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)\nConsequently, the appellate court has the power to allow the appeal notwithstanding the delay in the filing of the appellant's brief. If such delay was due to the inadvertence of the appellant's counsel, any of the following circumstances must be shown to exist to warrant the appellate court's liberality: (a) the recklessness or gross negligence of the counsel deprives the client due process of law; (b) the application of the rule will result in outright deprivation of property; or (c) the interests of justice so require. The second and third exceptions obtain in this case.\n\nNolasco was the possessor of the properties in question. With his appeal before the CA considered abandoned due to his failure to timely file an appellant's brief, he is set to lose his home on a mere technicality. While We do not condone non-compliance with the reglementary periods under the Rules, the more pressing concern of substantial justice impels Us to set aside the CA's dismissal of the appeal. The issue of whether Roberto, Nolasco's predecessor, had fully paid the property to Purence is crucial to the just determination of the case. Nolasco was not able to present his defense of payment and ownership in the RTC because he was declared in default, and in the CA because his appeal was dismissed. If there was indeed payment, it would be the height of injustice for Nolasco to be evicted from his own properties.\n\nIn Pongasi v. Court of Appeals,[30] We reinstated the appeal of therein petitioners and ordered the CA to admit the appellants' brief, noting that the case is one for partition and the conflicting assertions of the parties over property rights must be passed upon if only to ensure that the properties are awarded to those who rightfully deserve them.\n\nSimilarly, in Gregorio v. Court of Appeals,[31] We reinstated the appeal on the ground, inter alia, that the question of forgery in the supposed conveyance of property requires the examination of the record of the case. Hence, the late filing of the appellant's brief may be forgone.\n\nTime and again, We rule that technical rules must not suppress substantial justice. After all, dispensation of justice is the core reason for the existence of courts.[32] Our disquisition in Bigornia v. Court of Appeals[33] is enlightening, to wit:\nThe circulars of this Court prescribing technical and other procedural requirements are meant to promptly dispose of unmeritorious petitions that clog the docket and waste the time of the courts. These technical and procedural rules, however, are intended to ensure, not suppress, substantial justice. A deviation from their rigid enforcement may thus be allowed to attain their prime objective for, after all, the dispensation of justice is the core reason for the existence of courts. Thus, in a considerable number of cases, the Court has deemed it fit to suspend its own rules or to exempt a particular case from its strict operation where the appellant failed to perfect his appeal within the reglementary period, resulting in the appellate court's failure to obtain jurisdiction over the case. With more reason, there should be wider latitude in exempting a case from the strictures of procedural rules when the appellate court has already obtained jurisdiction over the appealed case and, as in this case, petitioners failed to file the appellants' brief on time.[34] (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)\nIn fine, We deem it appropriate to reinstate the appeal of Nolasco and afford him the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his appeal, rather than to deprive him of his properties outright.[35]\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The Resolutions dated August 30, 2019 and June 10, 2020 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 112755 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner's appeal is REINSTATED.

{"id":147,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 254381, February 14, 2022 ]\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. GILBERT ALEGRE Y NAZARAL, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nHERNANDO, J.:\n\nThis appeal[1] seeks to reverse and set aside the January 30, 2020 Decision[2] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 12447, which affirmed the November 13, 2018 Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Valenzuela City, Branch 75, in Criminal Case No. 179-V-14 finding accused-­appellant Gilbert Alegre y Nazaral (Alegre) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder.\n\nThe Factual Antecedents:\n\nOn February 7, 2014, an Information[4] for Murder was filed against Alegre, the accusatory portion of which reads:\nThat on or about December 1, 2013, in Valenzuela City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named, without any justifiable cause, with deliberate intent to kill and acting with treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot with a gun one Ronald Pascua y Raza (victim), hitting the latter's head and neck, thereby inflicting upon the latter serious physical injuries which caused his death.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.[5]\nUpon his arraignment on March 21, 2014, Alegre pleaded \"not guilty\" to the crime charged.[6] After the termination of the preliminary conference[7] and pre-trial,[8] trial on the merits subsequently ensued.\n\nVersion of the Prosecution:\n\nOn December 1, 2013, at around 7:00 p.m., security guards John Monito Tagle (Tagle), Ronald Pascua y Raza (Pascua), and Isidro Magpusao (Magpusao), were on duty at Century Glass Center located in Valenzuela City. At that time, they had just finished eating and Pascua was washing dishes.[9]\n\nA few moments later Tagle heard a knock on the gate. He opened the gate and saw Alegre, who was also a security guard thereat. Tagle asked Alegre what he was doing there and the latter replied that he just dropped by to ask how they were and to know if he could already report for duty. Tagle informed Alegre to report to the operations manager and he subsequently let him in.[10]\n\nAlegre then told Tagle that Pascua had been saying bad things about him. Tagle cautioned him to keep quiet as Pascua was just washing dishes inside. However, Pascua overheard their conversation and asked Alegre about what he was saying. Alegre then started cursing at Pascua and told him that he lost his job because of him. A heated exchange ensued between the two. Tagle tried to pacify and stop the squabble by leading Alegre out of the premises. However, Alegre continued to shout and curse at Pascua, who did not back down and also shouted expletives against Alegre.[11] Afterwards, Alegre motioned to his waist area and drew his .38 caliber gun. Pascua then told Alegre, \"wag mo akong daanin sa ganyan,\" but Alegre still pulled the trigger and shot him on the neck.[12] When Pascua dropped to the ground, Alegre approached him, almost kneeled on top of him, and proceeded to shoot him on the head.[13] Tagle then wrestled the gun away from Alegre, and he and Magpusao closed the gate to prevent Alegre from leaving but he was able to escape through another exit. Nevertheless, Tagle was able to chase after him and Alegre was brought to the police precinct thereafter.[14]\n\nPascua instantly died from the shooting and was later taken to Candido Funeral Homes. The autopsy conducted by medico-legal officer Police Chief Inspector Jocelyn Cruz confirmed that he died due to the gunshot wounds on the head and neck.[15] By reason of his death, Pascua's family allegedly incurred expenses totaling the amount of P86,900.00.[16]\n\nVersion of the Defense:\n\nFor his part, Alegre averred that on the day of the incident, he went to Century Glass Center to retrieve his things. At the premises, he saw Pascua, who started shouting and cursing at him. Alegre asked him what he wanted, but Pascua continued to hurl invectives at him. Alegre got fed up and brought out his gun. Pascua then told him not to resort to such, but Alegre already lost his patience and shot Pascua. Shocked at the sight of Pascua falling to the ground, Alegre ran out and boarded a \"kuliglig\" to leave the place.[17] \n \nRuling of the Regional Trial Court:\n \n\nIn a Decision dated November 13, 2018, the RTC ruled that all the elements of the crime of Murder were present in this case. The RTC found that the killing was qualified by treachery when Alegre deliberately shot Pascua twice, one on the head and another on the neck, which the latter did not foresee and which did not give him the opportunity to defend himself.[18] The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision states:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused GILBERT ALEGRE Y NAZARAL guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder punishable under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua without eligibility for parole.\n\nThe accused is hereby ordered to pay the heirs of Ronald Pascua y Raza the following:\n1. civil indemnity in the amount of Php 100,000.00;\n2. moral damages in the amount of Php 100,000.00;\n3. exemplary damages in the amount of Php 100,000.00; and\n4. actual damages in the amount of Php 86,900.00.\nThe aforesaid monetary award payable by accused are subject to interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.\n\nWith costs against the accused.[19]\nAggrieved, Alegre appealed to the CA, averring that the RTC gravely erred in convicting him of Murder despite the failure of the prosecution to prove all the elements thereof, and to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.[20] In particular, Alegre argued that treachery was not sufficiently alleged in the Information and was not adequately proved during trial.[21]\n\nRuling of the Court of Appeals:\n\nOn January 30, 2020, the CA promulgated its Decision denying Alegre's appeal. Similar to the RTC, the CA found that the prosecution sufficiently proved all the elements of Murder, including the qualifying circumstance of treachery. It likewise held that the same was adequately alleged in the Information, and noted that this issue was only brought up for the first time on appeal; thus, it became too late for Alegre to raise such an objection pursuant to Section 9, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court.[22] The CA thus ruled:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is DENIED. The Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela City, Branch 75, dated 13 November2018 in Criminal Case No. 179-V-14 is AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.[23]\nHence, this appeal.\n\nIssue:\n\nIn this case, Alegre admitted to shooting Pascua. There is no question that such act led to Pascua's death.[24] Thus, the sole issue to be resolved is whether the qualifying circumstance of treachery attended the killing of Pascua.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nAfter a judicious review of the records of the case, the Court holds that the conviction of Alegre for Murder cannot be upheld. He is properly liable only for Homicide.\n\nTreachery exists when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend to directly and specially ensure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.[25] To appreciate treachery as a qualifying circumstance, two conditions must be met: (1) the assailant employed means, methods or forms in the execution of the criminal act which give the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself\/herself or to retaliate; and (2) said means, methods or forms of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted by the assailant. The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an aggressor on the unsuspecting victim, denying the latter any chance to protect himself, and thereby ensuring its commission without posing any risk to the aggressor.[26]\n\nJurisprudence dictates that for treachery to be appreciated, it must be sufficiently pleaded in the Information in order not to violate the accused's constitutional right to be properly informed of the nature and cause of the charge against him.[27] In People v. Solar[28] (Solar), this Court held that:\n[I]t is insufficient for prosecutors to indicate in an Information that the act supposedly committed by the accused was done \"with treachery\" or \"with abuse of superior strength\" or \"with evident premeditation\" without specifically describing the acts done by the accused that made any or all of such circumstances present. Borrowing the words of the Court in Dasmariñas, \"to merely state in the information that treachery was attendant is not enough because the usage of such term is not a factual averment but a conclusion of law.\"\n\nAn information alleging that treachery exists, to be sufficient, must therefore have factual averments on how the person charged had deliberately employed means, methods or forms in the execution of the act that tended directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to the accused arising from the defense that the victim might make. The Information must so state such means, methods or forms in a manner that would enable a person of common understanding to know what offense was intended to be charged.[29]\nFurther, the Court, in Solar, laid down the following guidelines for the guidance of the Bench and Bar:\n1. Any information which alleges that a qualifying or aggravating circumstance — in which the law uses a broad term to embrace various situations in which it may exist, such as but are not limited to (1) treachery; (2) abuse of superior strength; (3) evident premeditation; (4) cruelty — is present, must state the ultimate facts relative to such circumstance. Otherwise, the Information may be subject to a motion to quash under Section 3 (e) (i.e., that it does not conform substantially to the prescribed form), Rule 117 of the Revised Rules [on] Criminal Procedure, or a motion for a bill of particulars under the parameters set by said Rules.\n\nFailure of the accused to avail any of the said remedies constitutes a waiver of his right to question the defective statement of the aggravating or qualifying circumstance in the Information, and consequently, the same may be appreciated against him if proven during trial.\n\nx x x x\n\n5. For cases in which a judgment or decision has already been rendered by the trial court and is still pending appeal, the case shall be judged by the appellate court depending on whether the accused has already waived his right to question the defective statement of the aggravating or qualifying circumstance in the Information, (i.e., whether he previously filed either a motion to quash under Section 3(e), Rule 117, or a motion for a bill of particulars) pursuant to this Decision.[30]\nHere, it is conceded that the Information against Alegre is defective insofar as it merely averred the existence of the qualifying offense of treachery without specifying the particular acts and circumstances that would constitute such. However, it is submitted that Alegre is deemed to have waived this defect, considering his failure to avail of the proper procedural remedies.[31]\n\nBased on the records, Alegre did not question the supposed insufficiency of the Information filed against him, through either a motion to quash or a motion for bill of particulars. He voluntarily entered his plea during the arraignment and proceeded with the trial. Thus, he is deemed to have waived any of the waivable defects in the Information, including the supposed lack of particularity in the description of the attendant circumstances. In other words, Alegre is deemed to have understood the acts imputed against him by the Information.[32] Further, as the CA had observed, the issue on the insufficiency of the Information was only raised for the first time on appeal.\n\nFrom the foregoing, since Alegre is considered to have waived his right to question the defective statement of the aggravating or qualifying circumstance in the Information, treachery may be appreciated against him if proven during trial.[33]\n\nOn this score, both the RTC and CA found that treachery was present in this case. In its decision, the CA ruled:\nIn this case, Alegre drew a gun. While Pascua told Alegre to not resort to violence (\"Wag mo akong daanin sa ganyan\"), Alegre proceeded to shoot him in the neck, a vulnerable area. Immediately thereafter, as Pascua slumped to the ground, Alegre approached Pascua and shot him in close range on the head. There was no way for Pascua, who was unarmed, and had instantaneously fallen, to retaliate. The attack was sudden, and being co-workers in Century Glass, Pascua could not have expected that Alegre would actually shoot him, in the neck no less.\n\nMoreover, the means Alegre employed to execute the crime was deliberately and consciously adopted. As pointed out by the OSG, Alegre brought a gun to the company premises when he allegedly only meant to retrieve his things. As soon as Tagle let him in, Alegre started talking about how Pascua had said bad things about him that cost him his job. Alegre knew exactly what he wanted to do when he went to Century Glass Center.[34]\nThe Court disagrees. It has been repeatedly held that \"chance encounters, impulse killing or crimes committed at the spur of the moment or that were preceded by heated altercations are generally not attended by treachery for lack of opportunity of the accused to deliberately employ a treacherous mode of attack.\"[35] Stated otherwise, there can be no treachery when the attack is preceded by a heated exchange of words between the accused and the victim, or when the victim is aware of the hostility of the assailant towards the former.[36]\n\nHere, Alegre had a heated altercation with Pascua before he finally lost his patience and shot him. When Pascua slumped to the ground after getting shot in the neck, Alegre moved closer and proceeded to shoot him in the head. Upon realizing what he had just done, he ran and attempted to escape, but was eventually caught by Tagle.\n\nBased on the attendant facts, Alegre's acts were more of a result of a sudden impulse or a spur of the moment decision due to his previous heated altercation with the victim, rather than a planned and deliberate action. There is no showing that he consciously employed a particular mode of attack in order to facilitate the killing without any risk to himself. It appears that Alegre shot Pascua because he got fed up and was carried away by the anger arising from his confrontation with the deceased. Further, it bears noting that Alegre shot Pascua in their workplace and in the presence of Tagle and Magpusao. If Alegre deliberately intended that no risk would come to him, he could have chosen another time and place to attack Pascua to ensure success in committing the crime. The records are also bereft of any indication that Alegre went to Century Glass Center knowing that Pascua would actually be there. Moreover, it is clear that Pascua was aware of Alegre's hostility against him and that there was a possibility of an impending atttack.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the Court finds that treachery was wanting in this case. In the absence thereof, Alegre can only be convicted of Homicide, not Murder.\n\nUnder Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty imposed for the crime of Homicide is reclusion temporal.[37] Considering that no modifying circumstances attended the commission of the crime, the penalty shall be imposed in its medium period. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum penalty shall be taken from the range of the medium period of reclusion temporal, with the minimum penalty selected from the range of prision mayor. Thus, this Court hereby imposes upon Alegre the penalty of imprisonment for a period of eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum.[38]\n\nAnent the award of damages, this Court finds that the RTC incorrectly granted P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim. In People v. Silvederio III,[39] this Court explained that these amounts are imposed when the penalty is death but reduced to reclusion perpetua because of Republic Act No. (RA) 9346.[40] Since the penalty imposed by the RTC in this case was reclusion perpetua only (not \"death but reduced to reclusion perpetua pursuant to RA 9346\"), the amounts awarded should have been P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages.[41] At any rate, considering that the conviction of the accused has been downgraded to Homicide, the amounts of the said damages must be modified to P50,000.00 each, following the ruling in People v. Jugueta.[42]\n\nWith regard to the actual damages awarded, this Court also finds that the RTC erred when it granted the amount of P86,900.00, given that this amount was a mere estimate provided by the wife of Pascua.[43] The amount of actual damages awarded to the heirs of the victim should be P59,712.25 since this is the amount supported by the receipts on record.[44] Finally, the amounts awarded shall earn interest of six percent (6%) per annum reckoned from the finality of this Decision until full payment.\n\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED IN PART.

{"id":148,"text":"THIRD DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 257358, December 05, 2022 ]\nATTY. MOISES DE GUIA DALISAY, JR., PETITIONER, VS. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN MINDANAO AND ATTY. DEXTER REY T. SUMAOY, RESPONDENTS.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\nINTING, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition for Certiorari[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court on the Joint Resolution[2] dated May 16, 2019, and the Joint Order[3] dated October 16, 2020, of the Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman) which dismissed, for insufficiency of evidence, the following cases:\nOMB-M-C-18-0324 for \"Violation of Section 3(e) of [Republic Act] No. [RA] 3019; Violation of Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code [RPC]\"; and\n\nOMB-M-A-18-0352 for \"Grave Abuse of Authority; Grave Misconduct; Serious Dishonesty; Violation of Section 1 of Administrative Order No. [AO] 239, Series of 2008.\"\nIn the Joint Resolution dated May 16, 2019, the Ombudsman dismissed both the criminal and administrative charges filed by Atty. Moises De Guia Dalisay, Jr. (petitioner) against Atty. Dexter Rey T. Sumaoy (private respondent). On motion for reconsideration,[4] the Ombudsman issued the Joint Order dated October 16, 2020, denying it for lack of merit.\n\nThe present petition before the Court explicitly states that it assails only the dismissal of the criminal charges under OMB-M-C-18-0324 for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 and violation of Article 171 of the RPC.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nThis case stemmed from petitioner's Affidavit-Complaint[5] dated April 12, 2018, filed against private respondent, who is the City Administrator of Iligan City, for violation of Section 3(e)[6] of RA 3019[7] violation of Article 171[8] of the RPC, Grave Abuse of Authority, Grave Misconduct, Serious Dishonesty, and violation of Section 1 of AO 239,[9] series of 2008.[10]\n\nIn the complaint, petitioner alleged that on August 1 and August 14, 2017, private respondent appeared as private counsel for John Philip Aragon Burlado (Burlado) in a libel case filed before Branch 44, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Initao, Misamis Oriental; that private respondent used a government vehicle to attend the preliminary and pre-trial conference on the dates mentioned in violation of Section 1,[11] AO 239; and that private respondent falsified his Daily Time Record (DTR) for August 2017 by making it appear that he worked full-time on August 1 and August 14, 2017, when in fact he did not.[12]\n\nIn his Counter-Affidavit,[13] private respondent averred that Iligan City Mayor Celso G. Regencia (Mayor Regencia) authorized him to engage in private practice and to serve as counsel for the city. He admitted having represented Burlado in the libel case but explained that it was only in a temporary capacity, and he already withdrew his appearance in the case. Private respondent emphasized that his appearance as Burlado's private counsel was ordered by Mayor Regencia because the cases filed against Burlado arose out of the latter's official duties; thus, Burlado as an employee of the City Information Office, should thus be assisted by the City Government. In support of his defense, he presented the following: (1) Memorandum[14] dated July 25, 2017, issued by Mayor Regencia; (2) Approved Request to Travel[15] on August 1, 2017; and (3) Approved Request to Travel[16] on August 14, 2017.[17]\n\nIn petitioner's reply, he argued that private respondent could not appear for and defend a government official at any stage of a criminal case.[18]\n\nRuling of the Ombudsman\n\nOn May 16, 2019, the Ombudsman rendered the assailed Joint Resolution[19] dismissing both the criminal and administrative charges against private respondent for insufficiency of evidence. The Ombudsman ruled that petitioner failed to discharge the burden of proving the existence of probable cause and to prove by substantial evidence the charges against private respondent.\n\nPetitioner filed a Joint Motion for Reconsideration of the Joint Resolution dated 16 May 2019 and for Reinvestigation[20] raising grave errors of facts and law or irregularities prejudicial to the rights or interests of petitioner.\n\nOn October 16, 2020, the Ombudsman rendered the assailed Joint Order[21] denying the joint motion for lack of merit.\n\nHence, the instant petition.\n\nPetitioner's Arguments\n\nIn the petition, petitioner is hinging on the following arguments to warrant the finding of probable cause against private respondent: First, there is no employer-employee relationship between Burlado and the City Government of Iligan because Burlado is a job order worker, and thus, Burlado is not entitled to the assistance of a government counsel, including lawyers from the City Government;[22] second, even if Burlado is an employee of the City Government, he is still not entitled to representation of a counsel from the City Government because he committed libel in his personal and not in his official capacity;[23] lastly, private respondent, in representing Burlado in the libel suit, was engaged in a private practice of law which needs an authority to practice pursuant to Section 12,[24] Rule XVIII of the Revised Civil Service Rules.[25]\n\nThe Issue\n\nWhether the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in not finding probable cause to charge private respondent with violations of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 and Article 171 of the RPC.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe petition is without merit.\n\nIt is well-entrenched in our jurisprudence that jurisdiction of the Court extends only to decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal or non-­administrative cases.[26] While the right to appeal is not granted to an aggrieved party in the orders and decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases, the aggrieved party may file directly before the Court a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure on the ground of grave abuse of discretion.[27]\n\nThe sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in not finding probable cause against private respondent for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 and Article 171 of the RPC. Generally, the Court does not interfere with the Ombudsman's findings as to whether probable cause exists.[28] To stress, this is an executive function and this exercise is in accordance with the Ombudsman's constitutionally-granted investigatory and prosecutorial powers.[29] In Presidential Ad Hoc Committee on Behest Loans v. Tabasondra,[30] the Court ratiocinated as follows:\nThe Ombudsman has the power to investigate and prosecute any act or omission of a public officer or employee when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient. In fact, the Ombudsman has the power to dismiss a complaint without going through a preliminary investigation, since he is the proper adjudicator of the question as to the existence of a case warranting the filing of information in court. The Ombudsman has discretion to determine whether a criminal case, given its facts and circumstances, should be filed or not. This is basically his prerogative.\n\nIn recognition of this power, the Court has been consistent not to interfere with the Ombudsman's exercise of his investigatory and prosecutory powers.\n\nVarious cases held that it is beyond the ambit of this Court to review the exercise of discretion of the Office of the Ombudsman in prosecuting or dismissing a complaint filed before it. Such initiative and independence are inherent in the Ombudsman who, beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and preserver of the integrity of the public service.\n\nThe rationale underlying the Court's ruling has been explained in numerous cases. The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they would be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant. In order to insulate the Office of the Ombudsman from outside pressure and improper influence, the Constitution as well as Republic Act No. 6770 saw fit to endow that office with a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutory powers, virtually free from legislative, executive or judicial intervention. If the Ombudsman, using professional judgment, finds the case dismissible, the Court shall respect such findings unless they are tainted with grave abuse of discretion.[31] (Emphasis supplied.)\nHowever, while the Ombudsman's findings as to whether probable cause exists are generally not reviewable by the Court, where there is an allegation of grave abuse of discretion, the Ombudsman's act cannot escape judicial scrutiny under the Court's own constitutional power and duty \"to determine whether or not there has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.\"[32]\n\nBy grave abuse of discretion, the Court means that which is capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. Thus, for the Court's exercise of judicial intervention, the Ombudsman's exercise of power must be done in an arbitrary or despotic manner or that which is so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.[33]\n\nA study of the present petition shows that petitioner failed to prove that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in not finding probable cause against private respondent. In fact, petitioner did not mention of any specific act or omission on the part of the Ombudsman that would show capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\n\nAs aptly determined by the Ombudsman, it is beyond dispute that the questioned travels of private respondent to Initao, Misamis Oriental, on August 1 and August 14, 2017, and his appearance before the RTC as Burlado's counsel were all duly approved and made upon the directive of Mayor Regencia.[34] Following the principle of presumption of regularity, private respondent's travels were considered official in character and his use of government vehicle for the purpose of attending the preliminary and pre-trial conference for Burlado's libel case was also considered valid and legal[35] unless substantially proved otherwise. Thus, respondent's DTRs cannot be said to have been falsified[36] on the ground that respondent cannot be faulted for following, in good faith, the order of Mayor Regencia.[37] Therefore, petitioner's allegation that private respondent committed the crime of Falsification under Section 171 of the RPC holds no water.\n\nMoreover, the Court, in Uriarte v. People,[38] explained that Section 3(e) of RA 3019 may be committed either by dolo, as when the accused acted with evident bad faith or manifest partiality, or by culpa as when the accused committed gross inexcusable negligence. Manifest partiality is a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another. Evident bad faith, on the other hand, does not only connote bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will. In other words, it requires the state of mind to be affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. Lastly, gross inexcusable negligence is the degree of negligence characterized by the want of even the slightest care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected.[39]\n\nIn this case, however, petitioner failed to prove that private respondent caused undue injury to the government, or that he gave any party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference to be indicted for Section 3(e) of RA 3019.\n\nIn other words, it is clear from the findings above that the Ombudsman considered, weighed, and passed upon all the evidence in the case. Notably, there was nothing capricious, whimsical, or arbitrary in the Ombudsman's exercise of judgment. Thus, any error committed by the Ombudsman in the evaluation of evidence \"is merely an error of judgment that cannot be remedied by certiorari.\"[40]\n\nTo reiterate, the Court stresses that the purpose of a preliminary investigation is to secure innocent persons against hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution, and to protect them from an open and public accusation of a crime, from the trouble, expense and anxiety of a public trial, and also to protect the State from useless and expensive trial.[41] To meet this end, it becomes imperative upon the prosecutorial arms of the State to relieve any person from the trauma of going through a trial once it is ascertained that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a prima facie case, or that no probable cause exists to form a sufficient belief as to the guilt of the accused.[42]\n\nIn sum, the petition must be dismissed absent a compelling reason to reverse the Ombudsman's factual findings and conclusion of lack of probable cause.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition for Certiorari against the Joint Resolution dated May 16, 2019, and the Joint Order dated October 16, 2020, of the Office of the Ombudsman dismissing the charges under OMB-M-C-18-0324 for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 and violation of Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code is DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCaguioa, (Chairperson), Gaerlan, and Singh, JJ., concur.\nDimaampao,* J., on official leave.\n","label":[[17,32,"CASE_NUM"],[34,51,"PROM_DATE"],[60,87,"PERSON"],[105,137,"INS"],[148,168,"PERSON"],[204,214,"PERSON"],[228,233,"INS"],[272,301,"STA"],[403,426,"INS"],[508,523,"CASE_NUM"],[559,586,"RA"],[601,638,"STA"],[652,667,"CASE_NUM"],[763,813,"STA"],[943,970,"PERSON"],[998,1018,"PERSON"],[1199,1204,"INS"],[1288,1303,"CASE_NUM"],[1337,1344,"RA"],[1362,1384,"STA"],[1582,1591,"STA"],[1601,1608,"RA"],[1625,1650,"STA"],[1733,1771,"STA"],[1904,1930,"PERSON"],[1932,1939,"PERSON"],[1981,2001,"INS"],[2003,2006,"INS"],[2175,2196,"STA"],[2462,2485,"PERSON"],[2493,2501,"PERSON"],[2617,2624,"PERSON"],[2804,2811,"PERSON"],[2851,2859,"PERSON"],[2892,2899,"PERSON"],[2949,2956,"PERSON"],[3163,3171,"PERSON"],[4439,4446,"PERSON"],[4489,4496,"PERSON"],[4530,4537,"PERSON"],[4661,4667,"PERSON"],[4914,4921,"PERSON"],[5031,5041,"STA"],[5047,5092,"STA"],[5294,5344,"STA"],[5351,5357,"INS"],[5467,5472,"INS"],[5738,5743,"INS"],[5776,5820,"STA"],[5893,5898,"INS"],[6047,6097,"STA"],[6114,6119,"INS"],[6379,6438,"CASE_NUM"],[6448,6453,"INS"],[7105,7110,"INS"],[7279,7284,"INS"],[7618,7623,"INS"],[7791,7814,"INS"],[8008,8031,"INS"],[8383,8406,"INS"],[8481,8502,"RA"],[8742,8747,"INS"],[8969,8974,"INS"],[9097,9102,"INS"],[9357,9362,"INS"],[9479,9484,"INS"],[10457,10464,"PERSON"],[10700,10707,"PERSON"],[10963,10971,"PERSON"],[11079,11101,"STA"],[11133,11138,"INS"],[11143,11160,"CASE_NUM"],[11181,11204,"RA"],[12441,12464,"RA"],[12877,12882,"INS"],[13890,13905,"STA"],[13923,13960,"RA"],[13978,14015,"STA"],[14044,14051,"PERSON"],[14068,14075,"PERSON"],[14081,14086,"PERSON"],[14101,14110,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nINTING, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is a Petition[1] for Certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the Commission on Audit (COA) Commission Proper (COA Proper) Decision No. 2020-334[2] dated January 31, 2020 that denied the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD)'s request for reconsideration of COA Legal Retainer Review (LRR) No. 2018-096 dated June 7, 2018.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nCentral to the present controversy is DSWD's hiring of Atty. Melanie D. Ortiz-Rosete (Atty. Ortiz-Rosete) as private legal retainer of DSWD Field Office No. 10 (FO). Previously, in 2015 and 2016, upon the Solicitor General's approval and COA's concurrence,[3] DSWD already contracted Atty. Ortiz-Rosete to appear as counsel in all civil cases pending before the trial courts and involving the FO or its officials.\n\nDSWD sought to continue its engagement of Atty. Ortiz-Rosete through 2017. Thus, on November 2, 2016, DSWD executed a Contract of Service[4] (Contract) rehiring Atty. Ortiz-Rosete as the FO's private legal retainer covering the period of January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 (2017 Contract).\n\nSubsequently, in a Letter[5] dated December 5, 2016, the DSWD requested the Solicitor General's approval to renew Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's authority to appear as the FO's counsel. The Solicitor General granted this request on May 22, 2017.[6] Later on, in a Letter[7] dated January 5, 2018, DSWD requested for the COA's concurrence in relation to the aforementioned hiring.\n\nRuling of the COA LRR\n\nThe COA LRR denied the request on account of DSWD's belated application for concurrence.[8] It noted that DSWD requested the COA to concur in the 2017 Contract only on January 5, 2018, or when said agreement had already expired. It explained as follows: First, requests of this nature must be obtained prior to hiring of a private lawyer or, in exceptional cases, the expiration of his contract.[9] Second, COA Circular No. 86-255,[10] as amended, requires the COA's concurrence as a pre­condition to a government agency's hiring of a private legal counsel.[11]\n\nSeeking compassion and leniency, DSWD moved for reconsideration[12] before the COA Proper. It cited the following reasons to justify Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's rehiring:\n1. The DSWD Central Office has only four lawyers x x x they cannot provide all the legal assistance sought by all DSWD FOs;\n\n2. It would be unjust for Atty. Ortiz-Rosete not to be compensated for the services she rendered in 2017;\n\n3. Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's expertise in legal matters pertaining to the DSWD has created trust and confidence between them;\n\n4. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) deputized Atty. Ortiz-Rosete as private legal counsel of DSWD FO No. 10 for the period of January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 as early as May 22, 2017. Likewise, Director Martha Roxana C. Sese, Cluster 6 – Health and Science, National Government Sector (NOS), this Commission, gave a favorable recommendation on the DSWD's request for concurrence in the Contract of Services of Atty. Ortiz­Rosete; and\n\n5. COA granted concurrence with respect to Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's 2015 and 2016 Contracts of Services, justifying the exceptional reasons for DSWD FO No. 10 to engage her services.[13]\nStated differently, DSWD asse1ied that Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's rehiring was justified because: (a) the DSWD Central Office's scarce legal manpower could no longer accommodate requests for legal assistance from the FOs; (b) DSWD developed trust and confidence in Atty. Ortiz­-Rosete on account of her previous years' service to DSWD; (c) the Solicitor General approved the 2017 Contract; (d) the COA Director already recommended that DSWD's request for concurrence be granted; and (e) the COA already concurred in the 2015 and 2016 Contracts hiring Atty. Ortiz-Rosete. Further, it pointed out that Atty. Ortiz-Rosete already rendered the required services pursuant to her 2017. Thus, she must be compensated for the work she has performed.[14]\n\nRuling of the COA Proper\n\nIn the assailed Decision No. 2020-334, the COA Proper denied DSWD's motion and affirmed the COA LRR's ruling.[15] It emphasized that, pursuant to COA Circular No. 86-255, as amended by COA Circular No. 95-011, as well as the Court's pronouncements in Polloso v. Hon. Gangan[16] (Polloso) and Phividec Industrial Authority v. Capital Steel Corporation,[17] the Solicitor General's approval and the COA's concurrence shall first be secured before the DSWD may engage the services of a private legal counsel.[18] Expenditures arising from the hiring of private lawyers without the aforementioned prior written conformities shall be considered as irregular expenditures.[19]\n\nWhile it is true that this procedural rule may be relaxed, it is incumbent upon the party invoking liberality to justify their noncompliance with the rules. In the present case, DSWD admitted that its request for concurrence relative to the 2017 Contract was filed late or when the Contract was already expired. DSWD did not offer any reason justifying specifically its belated filing.[20] Thus, the COA Proper found no reason to set aside the procedural requirements of prior approval by the Solicitor General and concurrence by the COA.\n\nTo be sure, the explanations provided by DSWD do not relate to its noncompliance with the rules or reasons the noncompliance may be excused. Rather, the averments (e.g., lack of DSWD lawyers\/necessity of engaging private lawyers, previous engagements of the same lawyer, previous concurrences by the COA, etc.) pertained to substantial matters cited to support DSWD's request\/application. Still, the COA Proper found the reasons insufficient[21] to warrant the COA's concurrence.\n\nThe COA Proper also ruled that the payment of Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's compensation shall be the responsibility of the DSWD officials who approved\/authorized the Contract on account of their clear violation of rules and regulations. According to the COA Proper, the ruling is supported by the Court's pronouncement in Polloso,[22] as well as Section 103[23] of Presidential Decree No. 1445.\n\nFurthermore, the COA Proper did not find persuasive DSWD's reliance on the COA Director's favorable recommendation relative to the 2017 Contract and the COA's prior year concurrences. First, the COA Director's action on its request for concurrence is merely recommendatory. Second, the COA's concurrences in 2015 and 2016 do not necessarily mean that all subsequent requests submitted by the COA will be granted automatically.[24]\n\nIssue\n\nDid the COA Proper commit grave abuse of discretion when it did not concur in the 2017 Contract rehiring Atty. Ortiz-Rosete on account of the lack of the required prior written conformities of the Solicitor General and the COA?\n\nOur Ruling\n\nThe Court resolves to dismiss the petition for lack of merit.\n\nI\n\nPreliminarily, the Court addresses matters of procedure concerning the timeliness of the present petition's filing and the sufficiency of the allegations contained therein.\n\nFirst, the following circumstances establish that the present petition was filed on time: (a) DSWD received a copy of the assailed ruling on November 11, 2020; (b) Pursuant to the 30-day reglementary period under Section 3, Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, DSWD had until December 11, 2020 to file its petition. However, right on the deadline, it requested for an additional 30 days;[25] (c) The Court granted this request and gave DSWD another 30 days counted from December 11, 2020 within which to file its petition; and (d) The 30th day of the extended period fell on January 10, 2021, a Sunday. DSWD filed the present petition on January 11, 2021, or the immediately succeeding business day.\n\nSecond, although timely, it is proper to dismiss the present petition outright for its lack of bona fide imputations of grave abuse against the COA Proper.\n\nThe Court's review of COA decisions via Rule 64 petitions is limited to jurisdictional errors or grave abuse of discretion.[26] In general, the Court shall dismiss the petition outright and uphold the COA's ruling[27] unless the petitioner establishes a prima facie case of grave abuse in his petition, that is, to specifically identify those acts committed by the COA that had been unauthorized, whimsical, or capricious.[28]\n\nThe grounds cited by DSWD for the allowance of the present petition only allege that: (a) there are exceptional circumstances surrounding the present case, and (b) Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's engagement in 2017 was necessary and indispensable.[29] The arguments, at best, point out mere errors of judgment. These are beyond the scope of certiorari proceedings.[30]\n\nII\n\nAt any rate, the Court finds the COA Proper's refusal to concur in the subject Contract to be in accord with the prevailing rules and jurisprudence.\n\nIn general, government entities are prohibited from securing the services of a private legal counsel. As the law office of the government, the Office of the Solicitor General is vested with the exclusive authority to represent the Philippine government, its agencies and instrumentalities and its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of a lawyer.[31] \n \nPrior Written Conformity\/Concurrence Requirement\n \n\nBy exception, government agencies may be allowed to engage a private lawyer, provided that they first comply with applicable rules and regulations. In particular, COA Circular No. 86-255, as amended by COA Circular No. 95-011, sets forth the following categorical requirement:\n[P]ublic funds shall not be utilized for payment of the services of a private legal counsel or law film to represent government agencies in court or to render legal services for them. In the event that such legal services cannot be avoided or is justified under extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, the written conformity and acquiescence of the Solicitor General or the Government Corporate Counsel, as the case may be, and the written concurrence of the Commission on Audit shall first be secured before the hiring or employment of a private lawyer or law firm. (Italics and underscoring supplied.)\nThe rule is clear: the prior written conformity and concurrence of the Solicitor General and COA, respectively, are indispensable. There must be strict compliance: it must be timely (i.e., obtained prior to the hiring or employment of private lawyer) and complete (i.e., approval\/concurrence of both the Solicitor General and COA). Otherwise, the engagement of a private lawyer is deemed unauthorized.[32]\n\nIn the present case, DSWD's alleged compliance with the rule is not only belated, but also incomplete. Following are the dates critical to DSWD's engagement of Atty. Ortiz-Rosete relative to calendar year 2017:\nEvent\nDate\nExecution of Contract\t\nNovember 2, 2016[33]\nLetter-Request to Solicitor General\t\nDecember 5, 2016[34]\nSolicitor General's Approval\t\nMay 22, 2017[35]\nRequest for COA Concurrence\t\nJanuary 5, 2018[36]\nThese make certain that there was an absolute lack of compliance on the part of DSWD.\n\nAs to timeliness. The attempts to secure the required approvals were post facto. DSWD decided to secure the required approvals only after it already finalized its agreement to rehire Atty. Ortiz-Rosete. Its request for COA concurrence was overdue, so much so that the Contract period (i.e., 2017) had already ended by the time DSWD sent out its application to the COA.\n\nIt is of no moment that the Solicitor General eventually authorized DSWD to hire a private lawyer. The approval was issued when the Contract was already executory (i.e., May 22, 2017). The Solicitor General cannot be blamed for his delayed action on DSWD's request. If the government agency's request per se was already made beyond the time allowed, certainly, there is no reason to expect the approving authority to act on the request in a timely manner.\n\nAs to completeness. Even if the Court assumes that the Solicitor General's approval was requested for and secured on time, one approval would have amounted only to a partial compliance. That the COA ultimately withheld its concurrence emphasizes that the required COA approval was never obtained.\n\nContrary to DSWD's theory, a COA Director's favorable recommendation cannot take the place of a COA concurrence. Only the COA Proper[37] is authorized to issue a written concurrence in the hiring of a legal retainer. Certainly, the COA Proper may seek the indorsement or specific action of a subordinate COA official or office in the process of evaluating a request. However, said official\/office's advice, at best, is only recommendatory. It is not binding because the COA Proper, by the nature of its authority, may make an independent evaluation of the request. \n \nExemptions from the requirement\n \n\nNotably, one special instance where a government instrumentality may be excused from compliance with the absolute rule requiring the Solicitor General and COA's prior approval\/concurrence is when the COA is guilty of inordinate delay in acting on the request for concurrence. In the recent case of Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. v. Commission on Audit,[38] the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM) engaged the services of external legal advisers \"on the privatization of the generation assets and Independent Power Producer x x x contracts of the National Power Corporation x x x.\"[39] Similarly, the COA denied PSALM's request for concurrence after finding that proceeded to hire private lawyers without the COA's prior conformity. However, the Court reversed the COA's ruling upon the following observations:\nHere, COA took a whopping four hundred four (404) days from receipt of the request to make an initial evaluation thereof, and thereafter, to request additional documents from PSALM. From the latter's submission of the documents, COA used up another four hundred sixteen (416) days before it finally issued a resolution of denial, citing as ground its lack of prior concurrence which, as shown, was the end result of its own inordinate delay or inaction.\n\nIn its Memorandum, COA admits that it could not and does not always observe the sixty (60)-day period under PD 1445 and the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure in view of the sheer volume of requests it receives every year given the number of clientele it serves, which is just one of the many functions it performs. It also receives an influx of various requests for money claims, relief of accountability, and appeals.\n\nBut we do not find COA's delayed action on the subject request to be reasonable and justified. We also reject COA's reasoning as a justification for delays in other situations. For if we simply accept this reasoning and justify any other delays in past and future cases, either pending or soon to be initiated with this Court, nothing will prevent this faux pas from occurring over and over again. For this reason, we now have to intervene by reasonable measures that the law itself has imposed as will be more lengthily discussed below.\n\nCOA's inordinate delay on PSALM's request for concurrence amounted to grave abuse of discretion as it violates PSALM's right to a speedy disposition of its case x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nx x x PSALM cannot be faulted when it proceeded to engage the services of the legal advisors even without COA's concurrence. For sure, PSALM could not have ended up in serious breach of its mandate to privatize.[40]\nPSALM proceeded to engage private lawyers while their request was pending before the COA. Its request was filed on time, only that COA's action on the request was overdue. In other words, the Court relaxed the concurrence requirement because \"it was the [COA], the approving authority itself, that caused unreasonable delay that led to the required written concurrence not being obtained.\"[41]\n\nIn contrast, DSWD's glaring misstep here lies in having executed and completed the Contract without even requesting for the COA's conformity. Even its letter-request to the Solicitor General was sent only after it had already finalized the Contract.\n\nParenthetically, the COA has just recently recognized that the prior written concurrence requirement may have caused unnecessary delays in the hiring of private lawyers by government instrumentalities in need of urgent legal services. To expedite the approval process, the COA promulgated COA Circular No. 2021-003 dated July 16, 2021 exempting national government agencies and government-owned or -controlled corporations from the prior written COA concurrence requirement subject to certain conditions. This circular took effect on August 12, 2021.[42]\n\nVerily, DSWD raises the defense that the COA concurrences it had obtained for Atty. Ortiz-Rosete's Contracts in 2015 and 2016 dispense with the concurrence requirement for 2017. However, even the new rule cited above does not allow this. To be sure, no law or issuance provides for an exemption for legal services contracts renewed from and concurred in by the COA in previous years. The prior written concurrence requirement remains as the general rule and there is no reason justifying its relaxation in the present case.\n\nAll in all, the Court views DSWD's belated attempts to comply as mere afterthoughts to mend the irregular rehiring of Atty. Ortiz-Rosete. It must be stressed that there was a complete absence of the Solicitor General and COA's respective approvals when DSWD entered into the agreement, all throughout the contract period, and even upon and after its expiration. DSWD does not even deny its noncompliance. These considerations make certain that DSWD's execution of the Contract was premature and unauthorized.\n\nFinally, this is not a disallowance case. Thus, the Court's pronouncement shall not include a determination of the validity of payments made to Atty. Ortiz-Rosete under the 2017 Contract or the liability over any such payments.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari is DISMISSED for lack of merit. The assailed Decision No. 2020-334 dated January 31, 2020 of the Commission on Audit Commission Proper is AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nGesmundo, C.J., Leonen, SAJ., Caguioa, Hernando, Lazaro-Javier, Zalameda, M.

ROMMEL DELA CRUZ Y MENDOZA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\nINTING, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is an appeal[1] seeking the reversal of the Decision[2] dated December 11, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 11874 which affirmed the Decision[3] dated August 7, 2018 of Branch 68, Regional Trial Court (RTC), xxxxxxxxxxx, Pangasinan that found Rommel dela Cruz y Mendoza (accused-­appellant) guilty of two (2) counts of Sexual Abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of Republic Act No. (RA) 7610 in Criminal Case Nos. L-10160 and L-10161.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nThe case stemmed from two (2) Informations filed before the RTC, the accusatory portions of which state:\nCriminal Case No. L-10160\n\n\"That sometime in the morning of February 10, 2012 in xxxxxxxxxxx Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, an adult taking advantage of the vulnerability of AAA, a 14 year old minor child (DOB-August 25, 1998), did, then and there willfully and unlawfully coerce and influence the said minor child to indulge into a sexual intercourse with him inside the bedroom of the residential house of his grandmother to the prejudice and damage of the said minor child.\n\nContrary to Sec. 5(b), Art. III of R.A. 7610 (Anti-Child Abuse Act).\"[4]\n\nCriminal Case No. L-10161\n\n\"That sometime in the morning of October 18, 2013 in xxxxxxxxxxx Pangasinan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, an adult taking advantage of the vulnerability of AAA, a 15 year old minor child (DOB-August 25, 1998), did, then and there willfully and unlawfully coerce and influence the said minor child to indulge into a sexual intercourse with him inside the bedroom of the residential house of his grandmother and damage of the said minor child.\n\nContrary to Sec. 5(b), Art. III of R.A. 7610 (Anti-Child Abuse Act).\"[5]\nWhen arraigned, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges. Pre-trial and trial ensued.[6]\n\nVersion of the Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution narrated that on February 10, 2012, AAA[7] was on her way to school when she saw accused-appellant, her textmate. Accused-appellant held her hand, hailed a tricycle, and brought her to the house of his grandmother in xxxxxxxxxxx, Pangasinan. There, they watched a television show for 30 minutes. Thereafter, accused­-appellant pulled AAA towards a room and started kissing her on the lips. He took off her uniform, pushed her towards the bed, went on top of her, and kissed her. Accused-appellant then removed his pants and inserted his penis into AAA's vagina for about 25 minutes. Accused-appellant succeeded in his lustful act. They left the house, boarded a tricycle, and headed to the town proper. Out of fear, AAA did not tell anyone about the incident.[8]\n\nThe second incident occurred on October 18, 2013 when AAA was in the public market. Accused-appellant saw her and called a tricycle. As in the previous incident, they proceeded to his grandmother's house in xxxxxxxxxxx. They were watching a television show when accused­-appellant pulled her towards a room. Inside the room, he kissed her on the lips. Accused-appellant undressed her, went on top of her, and inserted his penis into her vagina. AAA tried to resist by slapping and pushing him away, but she failed. Later, accused-appellant called a tricycle, and they headed to the town proper.[9]\n\nVersion of the Defense\n\nAccused-appellant admitted that he had sexual intercourse with AAA, but denied that he forced her. According to him, AAA was his girlfriend. They often went to the house of a friend or the house of his grandmother to watch television shows and listen to music.[10]\n\nThe RTC Ruling\n\nIn the Decision[11] dated August 7, 2018, the RTC found accused­-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charges. It ruled that: (1) accused-appellant induced and unduly influenced AAA to have sexual intercourse with him; (2) assuming they were sweethearts, their relationship will not exonerate him from the charges as AAA was just a minor during the incidents, while accused-appellant was already 20 years old; and (3) with his age, accused-appellant could easily force his will upon AAA.[12]\n\nThe fallo of the RTC decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, this court hereby renders judgment as follows:\n\n1) In Criminal Case No. L-10160 (violation of Section 5(b), R.A. 7610) - accused ROMMEL dela CRUZ y Mendoza is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of other sexual abuse under Section 5(b), R.A. 7610, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Twelve (12) Years, Five (5) Months and Eleven (11) Days of prision mayor medium to reclusion temporal minimum, as minimum, to Seventeen (17) Years and Four (4) Months of reclusion temporal medium to reclusion perpetua, as maximum.

The judgment of conviction of accused-appellant ROMMEL dela CRUZ y MENDOZA in the assailed Decision dated 07 August 2018 of the Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx, Pangasinan City, Branch 68 for both Criminal Case Nos. L-10160 and 10161 is hereby AFFIRMED in toto.\n\nSO ORDERED.[15]\nInsisting on his innocence, accused-appellant appeals his conviction before the Court.\n\nIn the Resolution[16] dated September 14, 2020, the Court noted the transmittal of the records forwarded by the CA. The Court also ordered the parties to file their respective supplemental briefs, should they so desire, within 30 days from notice.\n\nIn his Manifestation (In Lieu of Supplemental Brief)[17] dated November 25, 2020, accused-appellant adopted his Supplemental Brief filed before the CA as it adequately discussed all the matters pertinent to his defense. Meanwhile, in its Manifestation (In Lieu of Supplemental Brief)[18] dated December 21, 2020, the People, through the Office of the Solicitor General, prayed that it be excused from filing a supplemental brief as it had already extensively addressed all the matters and issues raised by accused-appellant in its brief filed before the CA.\n\nIssue\n\nIn the main, the issue to be resolved is whether the CA erred in affirming accused-appellant's conviction.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe appeal has no merit.\n\nThe RTC and the CA were correct in their assessment of the testimonies of AAA and her mother. On the basis of AAA's testimony, the RTC and the CA uniformly found that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA against her will or without her consent.[19] The Court sees no reason to depart from the RTC's assessment of AAA's credibility.[20]\n\nAAA's recollection of her ordeal clearly established that on two separate dates, accused-appellant forced her to board the tricycle going to the house of his grandmother.[21] Thereat, he pulled her towards a room and pushed her onto the bed after undressing her.[22] She resisted the sexual advances of accused-appellant by slapping him but to no avail.[23] Considering the RTC's \"unique position to observe and weigh that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying,\"[24] the Court \"accords great respect and even confer[s] finality to the findings of the trial court as to matters which are factual in nature as well as its assessment of the credibility of witnesses.\"[25] In the absence of any evidence \"that the trial court's factual findings were tainted with arbitrariness or that the trial court overlooked or misapplied relevant facts and circumstances, or inadequately calibrated the witnesses' credibility, the reviewing court is bound by its assessment.\"[26]\n\nThe RTC convicted accused-appellant of Sexual Abuse under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 in both Criminal Case Nos. L-10160 and L-10161. The CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC. However, there is a need to fix the error in the nomenclature of accused-appellant's crime. Accused-appellant should be held criminally liable for two (2) counts of Rape under paragraph 1(a), Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code. The Court cannot sustain the RTC's pronouncement that the prosecution had established accused-appellant's criminal liability under Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, which provides:\nSection 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. — Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.\n\nx x x x\n\n(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period;\nSexual Abuse under Section 5, Article III of RA 7610 has the following elements: (1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and (3) the child whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.[27] Under the circumstances, AAA cannot be deemed to be a child \"exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse;\"[28] hence, the second element is patently lacking in the case. Instead, the prosecution's evidence clearly established the elements under paragraph 1, Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353.[29] Thus:\nART. 266-A. Rape, When and How Committed. — Rape is committed —\n\n1. By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:\n\na. Through force, threat, or intimidation;\nb. When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;\nc. By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and\nd. When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.\nThe circumstance applicable in the case is paragraph 1(a). The fact of carnal knowledge was established through AAA's positive identification of accused-appellant as her abuser. She testified that accused-appellant undressed her, positioned himself on top of her, and inserted his penis into her vagina on two separate dates.[30] With the prosecution sufficiently establishing all the elements of Rape applicable in the case, accused-appellant's guilt was proved beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nIn People v. Ejercito,[31] the Court held that the Anti-Rape Law or RA 8353, amending the RPC, should be uniformly applied in rape cases against minors. Accordingly, \"penal laws are crafted by legislature to punish certain acts, and when two (2) penal laws may both theoretically apply to the same case, then the law which is more special in nature, regardless of the time of enactment, should prevail.\"[32]\n\nIn People v. Tulagan,[33] the Court further explained:\nAssuming that the elements of both violations of Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 and of Article 266-A, paragraph 1 (a) of the RPC are mistakenly alleged in the same Information — e.g., carnal knowledge or sexual intercourse was due to \"force or intimidation\" with the added phrase of \"due to coercion or influence,\" one of the elements of Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610; or in many instances wrongfully designate the crime in the Information as violation of \"Article 266-A, paragraph 1 (a) in relation to Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610,\" although this may be a ground for quashal of the Information under Section 3 (f) of Rule 117 of the Rules of Court — and proven during the trial in a case where the victim who is 12 years old or under 18 did not consent to the sexual intercourse, the accused should still be prosecuted pursuant to the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 8353, which is the more recent and special penal legislation that is not only consistent, but also strengthens the policies of R.A. No. 7610. Indeed, while R.A. No. 7610 is a special law specifically enacted to provide special protection to children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation and discrimination and other conditions prejudicial to their development, We hold that it is contrary to the legislative intent of the same law if the lesser penalty (reclusion temporal medium to reclusion perpetua) under Section 5(b) thereof would be imposed against the perpetrator of sexual intercourse with a child 12 years of age or below 18.\n\nArticle 266-A, paragraph 1(a) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 8353, is not only the more recent law, but also deals more particularly with all rape cases, hence, its short title \"The Anti-Rape Law of 1997.\" R.A. No. 8353 upholds the policies and principles of R.A. No. 7610, and provides a \"stronger deterrence and special protection against child abuse,\" as it imposes a more severe penalty of reclusion perpetua under Article 266-B of the RPC, x x x[34]\nAll the same, in bidding for his acquittal, accused-appellant argued that he and AAA were sweethearts.\n\nThe Court is not convinced.\n\nAs an affirmative defense, the \"sweetheart theory\" is actually \"an admission of carnal knowledge of the victim,\" and consequently, the Court \"places on the accused the burden of proving the supposed relationship by substantial evidence.\"[35] Moreover, the defense cannot just present testimonial evidence in support of the theory. Independent proof like tokens, mementos, and photographs are required.[36] Unfortunately for accused-appellant, he presented no such evidence to substantiate his claim. Assuming that they have a relationship, accused-appellant cannot just force AAA to have sex against her will. Verily, \"[a] man does not have the unbridled license to subject his beloved to his unreciprocated carnal desires.\"[37] Besides, \"the filing of criminal charges are not acts of a woman savoring a consensual coitus but that of a maiden seeking retribution for the outrage committed against her.\"[38]\n\nIn the case, accused-appellant may properly be convicted of Rape without violating his due process rights and the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations against him. It is very clear from the allegations in the Informations that they constitute criminal charges for Rape under paragraph 1, Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353. To be sure, the Informations satisfactorily mentioned and charged accused-appellant with carnal knowledge of AAA, a minor, by willfully and unlawfully coercing the latter to have sexual intercourse with him on February 10, 2012 and October 18, 2013.[39] These allegations are sufficiently clear to inform him of the acts he is being liable for and adequate to enable him to form a defense.\n\nAs both the recital in the Informations and the evidence presented by the prosecution provide for a case that can be prosecuted and penalized as Rape under paragraph 1, Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, accused-appellant should be properly convicted and penalized therefor. The Court imposes the penalty of reclusion perpetua against accused-appellant in Criminal Case Nos. L-10160 and L-10161. He is also ordered to pay AAA the following for each count of Rape: (a) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (b) P75,000.00 as moral damages; (c) P75,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (d) legal interest rate of 6% per annum on all damages awarded from the date of finality of this Resolution until fully paid, pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence.[40]\n\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Decision dated December 11, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 11874 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that accused-appellant Rommel dela Cruz y Mendoza is found GUILTY of two (2) counts of Rape under paragraph 1(a), Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and is ORDERED to pay the victim, AAA, the following amounts: (1) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P75,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) P75,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count. All amounts due shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of this Resolution until full payment.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPerlas-Bernabe, S.A.J., (Chairperson), Hernando, Gaerlan, and Dimaampao, JJ., concur.","label":[[17,32,"CASE_NUM"],[34,51,"PROM_DATE"],[54,79,"INS"],[105,131,"PERSON"],[173,183,"PERSON"],[197,202,"INS"],[290,306,"INS"],[308,310,"INS"],[315,338,"CASE_NUM"],[405,425,"INS"],[427,430,"INS"],[468,494,"PERSON"],[563,618,"RA"],[622,660,"CASE_NUM"],[740,743,"INS"],[785,810,"CASE_NUM"],[936,941,"INS"],[1334,1366,"RA"],[1396,1421,"CASE_NUM"],[1545,1550,"INS"],[1926,1958,"RA"],[3789,3792,"INS"],[3847,3850,"INS"],[4322,4325,"INS"],[4433,4458,"CASE_NUM"],[4473,4496,"RA"],[4508,4534,"PERSON"],[4616,4639,"RA"],[5304,5329,"CASE_NUM"],[5344,5367,"RA"],[5379,5405,"PERSON"],[5487,5510,"CASE_NUM"],[6381,6417,"STA"],[6492,6494,"INS"],[6511,6513,"INS"],[6549,6551,"INS"],[6709,6735,"PERSON"],[6789,6809,"INS"],[6862,6898,"CASE_NUM"],[7024,7029,"INS"],[7084,7089,"INS"],[7144,7146,"INS"],[7152,7157,"INS"],[7429,7431,"INS"],[7618,7649,"INS"],[7835,7837,"INS"],[7900,7902,"INS"],[7959,7964,"INS"],[8005,8008,"INS"],[8017,8019,"INS"],[8132,8135,"INS"],[8144,8146,"INS"],[8263,8268,"INS"],[8303,8306,"INS"],[8721,8724,"INS"],[8875,8880,"INS"],[9373,9376,"INS"],[9427,9463,"RA"],[9472,9510,"CASE_NUM"],[9516,9518,"INS"],[9546,9549,"INS"],[9743,9756,"STA"],[9773,9786,"STA"],[9819,9824,"INS"],[9844,9847,"INS"],[9946,9982,"RA"],[10000,10009,"STA"],[10604,10628,"STA"],[10643,10670,"STA"],[10928,10961,"STA"],[11502,11526,"STA"],[11542,11549,"RA"],[11561,11571,"STA"],[12548,12566,"CASE_NUM"],[12576,12581,"INS"],[12613,12620,"RA"],[12957,12974,"CASE_NUM"],[12984,12989,"INS"],[13074,13087,"RA"],[13095,13108,"STA"],[13363,13376,"RA"],[13466,13479,"STA"],[13529,13542,"RA"],[13629,13659,"STA"],[13866,13879,"RA"],[14002,14015,"RA"],[14031,14044,"RA"],[14403,14412,"STA"],[14530,14543,"STA"],[14575,14588,"STA"],[14614,14628,"RA"],[14741,14766,"STA"],[14769,14782,"RA"],[14822,14835,"RA"],[14982,14995,"STA"],[15126,15131,"INS"],[15286,15291,"INS"],[16375,16388,"STA"],[16405,16418,"STA"],[16445,16452,"RA"],[17014,17027,"STA"],[17043,17067,"STA"],[17083,17090,"RA"],[17167,17172,"INS"],[17244,17282,"CASE_NUM"],[17710,17726,"INS"],[17730,17753,"STA"],[17810,17836,"PERSON"],[17901,17914,"STA"],[17931,17944,"STA"],[17987,18008,"RA"],[18416,18429,"PERSON"],[18455,18463,"PERSON"],[18465,18472,"PERSON"],[18478,18487,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":151,"text":"A.C. No. 12552, December 05, 2022 ]\nJUDGE ADELBERT S. SANTILLAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. NEPTHALI P. SOLILAPSI, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nINTING, J.:\n\nBefore the Court is the Report and Recommendation[1] dated January 6, 2020 of Executive Judge Adelbert S. Santillan (Judge Santillan) of the Regional Trial Court, Polomolok, South Cotabato recommending that respondent Atty. Nepthali P. Solilapsi (Atty. Solilapsi) be disqualified from being commissioned as a notary public for a period of two years for notarizing more than 300 legal documents with an expired notarial commission in violation of Administrative Matter No. 02-8-13-SC,[2] or the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (the Notarial Rules).[3]\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nSometime in March 2019, a certain Princess Ivory Cabaguas Villanueva requested the office of Judge Santillan to issue a Certificate of Notarial Act indicating that Atty. Solilapsi recently notarized a Certificate of End of Contract and an Affidavit of Employment.[4]\n\nBecause of the request, Judge Santillan discovered that Atty. Solilapsi notarized the documents in March 2019 despite the expiration of his notarial commission in December 2018.[5]\n\nOn March 18, 2019, Judge Santillan issued Memorandum No. 8, Series of 2019 directing Atty. Solilapsi to explain and show cause why no disciplinary action should be meted out against him.[6]\n\nIn his Letter-Explanation,[7] Atty. Solilapsi stated that the subject documents were notarized by his law office, but he only discovered their existence when his attention was called regarding the matter.[8] Further, he averred that the documents were notarized in his absence and without his knowledge and permission.[9]\n\nThrough a Letter[10] dated March 27, 2019, Judge Santillan reported the incident to the Office of the Court Administrator and recommended the filing of an administrative complaint against Atty. Solilapsi for violation of the Notarial Rules.[11]\n\nOn June 3, 2019, the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) acknowledged the administrative complaint and recommended that it be referred to Judge Santillan for investigation and adjudication.[12]\n\nIn the Resolution[13] dated July 24, 2019, the Court adopted the OBC's recommendation, deemed the Letter dated March 27, 2019 as an official report, docketed it as a regular administrative case, and refe1Ted the case to Judge Santillan for investigation.[14]\n\nDuring his investigation, Judge Santillan discovered that the Certificate of End of Contract and the Affidavit of Employment were the 208th and 331st documents, respectively, that Atty. Solilapsi notarized after the lapse of his notarial commission in December 2018.[15] He found that Atty. Solilapsi had notarized more than 300 documents with an expired notarial commission.[16] As such, Judge Santillan did not give credence to the excuse of Atty. Solilapsi that the subject documents were notarized in his absence and without his knowledge and permission.[17]\n\nIn his Report and Recommendation[18] dated January 6, 2020, Judge Santillan recommended that Atty. Solilapsi be disqualified from being commissioned as notary public from January 2020 to December 2021 for notarizing more than 300 legal documents with an expired notarial commission.[19]\n\nIn the Resolution[20] dated September 21, 2020, the Court resolved to treat the Report and Recommendation of Judge Santillan as an administrative complaint and to require Atty. Solilapsi to comment thereon within 10 days from notice.[21] There being no comment filed to date, the Court dispenses with the filing thereof and now proceeds to decide the case on its merits.\n\nThe Issue\n\nWhether Atty. Solilapsi should be held administratively liable for having notarized more than 300 legal documents despite the expiration of his notarial commission.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe Court agrees with the findings of Judge Santillan but modifies the penalty to be imposed against Atty. Solilapsi in view of applicable jurisprudence.\n\nIt has oft-repeatedly been enunciated that \"notarization is not an empty, meaningless, [and] routinary act. It is invested with substantive public interest, such that only those who are qualified or authorized may act as notaries public.\"[22] To protect that interest, anyone who is not qualified or authorized to act must be precluded from exercising such authority upon the public, the courts, and the administrative offices in general.[23] Thus, without the requisite notarial commission, a lawyer is proscribed from performing any of the notarial acts allowed under the Notarial Rules.[24]\n\nHere, it is undisputed that Atty. Solilapsi had notarized more than 300 legal documents with an expired notarial commission. That his office staff notarized the subject documents in his absence and without his knowledge and permission is not an acceptable excuse that would absolve him of any administrative liability in the case. After all, it is his bounden duty as a notary public to ensure that only those who are qualified or authorized may act as such.[25] Thus, he cannot relieve himself of this responsibility by feigning ignorance of the acts of his office staff and passing the buck to them.\n\nBesides, the Court finds incredible the allegation of Atty. Solilapsi that he had no knowledge of the notarial acts done by his office staff. To accept his explanation that he was unaware of the notarization of over 300 legal documents, performed in his name and in his law office, is unthinkable as it is contrary to natural human experience.\n\nIn the case of Nunga v. Atty. Viray,[26] the Court ruled that a member of the Bar who notarizes a document at a time when he or she had no authorization or commission to do so may be subjected to a disciplinary action for having violated the Notarial Rules as well as the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).[27]\n\nSimilarly, by performing notarial acts with an expired notarial commission, Atty. Solilapsi violated Section 11,[28] Rule III of the Notarial Rules, the Lawyer's Oath, and Rule 1.01, Canon 1 and Canon 7 of the CPR, which provides:\nCanon 1 — A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes.\n\nRule 1.01 — A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.\n\nCanon 7 — A lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession and support the activities of the integrated bar.\nThe Court, in a number of cases, has subjected lawyers to disciplinary action for notarizing documents with expired notarial commissions. Specifically, the Court has imposed the penalties of suspension from the practice of law ranging from two to three years as well as permanent disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public upon erring lawyers depending on the gravity of their transgressions.[29]\n\nLet it be known that the Court will not hesitate to mete out a heavier penalty to lawyers who casually violate the Notarial Rules and disregard their sworn duties and responsibilities as members of the Bar.\n\nGiven Atty. Solilapsi's notarization of more than 300 legal documents with an expired notarial commission, the Court finds it proper to impose against him the penalties of suspension from the practice of law for a period of two (2) years and permanent disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.[30]\n\nWHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Nepthali P.

Y OBIASCA A.K.A. \"JR,\" ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nKHO, JR., J.:\n\nAssailed in this ordinary appeal[1] is the Decision[2] dated May 29, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09455, which affirmed in toto the Decision[3] dated May 15, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 5 (RTC), finding accused-appellant Eduardo Cericos, Jr. y Obiasca a.k.a. \"JR\" (Cericos) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) counts of Rape, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A(l)(a), in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code[4] (RPC), as amended.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThis case stemmed from five (5) Informations[5] filed before the RTC, charging Cericos of four (4) counts of Rape and one (1) count of Forcible Abduction with Rape, the accusatory portions of which read:\nCriminal Case No. 16-328295\n(Forcible Abduction with Rape)\n\nThat around midday of August 18, 2016, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, with lewd designs and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take and carry away AAA[248997],[6] 15 years old minor, without her intelligent consent, and brought her to the house of the accused located at xxxxxxxxxxx, this City, where the latter, by means of force, violence, and intimidation had carnal knowledge of said AAA[248997].\n\nContrary to law.[7]\n\nCriminal Case No. 16-328296\n(Rape)\n\nThat in the evening of August 18, 2016, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeed in having carnal knowledge of one AAA[248997], a 15 year old minor, by then and there taking off her clothes and inserting his penis inside her vagina, against the will and without the intelligent consent of the said AAA[248997].\n\nContrary to law.[8]\n\nCriminal Case No. 16-328297\n(Rape)\n\nThat in the morning of August 19, 2016, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeed in having carnal knowledge of one AAA[248997], a 15 year old minor, by then and there kissing her breasts, licking her vagina, and then inserting his penis inside her vagina, against the will and without the intelligent consent of the said AAA[248997].\n\nContrary to law.[9]\n\nCriminal Case No. 16-328298\n(Rape)\n\nThat around midday of August 19, 2016 in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeed in having carnal knowledge of one AAA[248997], a 15 year old minor, by then and there kissing her breasts, licking her vagina, and then inserting his penis inside her vagina, against the will and without the intelligent consent of the said AAA[248997].\n\nContrary to law.[10]\n\nCriminal Case No. 16-328299\n(Rape)\n\nThat on or about August 20, 2016, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeed in having carnal knowledge of one AAA[248997], a 15 year old minor, by then and there kissing her breasts, licking her vagina, and then inserting his penis inside her vagina, against the will and without the intelligent consent of the said AAA[248997].[11]\nThe prosecution alleged that AAA248997 met Cericos on social media. At around 3:00 a.m. of August 18, 2016, AAA248997 surreptitiously left their house and went to Tanay, Rizal to personally meet Cericos. After they met, Cericos brought AAA248997 to his house in xxxxxxxxxxx, Manila. Thereat, they first had a meal, and thereafter, Cericos asked AAA248997 to undress. When AAA248997 refused, Cericos forcibly undressed AAA248997 and had carnal knowledge of her despite the latter's active resistance and protestations (subject of Criminal Case No. 16-328295). Later that afternoon, AAA248997 escaped from Cericos' house but got lost in the process due to her unfamiliarity with the area. When Cericos' sister-in-law saw her, she was brought back to the house. On the night of even date, Cericos again forcibly undressed AAA248997 while the latter tried to push him away, but she was unsuccessful because her left arm was already aching. Cericos then licked her breast, inserted his penis into her vagina, and satisfied his bestial desires until he went to sleep. According to AAA248997, she could only cry in silence while Cericos was sleeping as she feared that Cericos would get angry and do worse things to her (subject of Criminal Case No. 16-328296).[12]\n \nThe next morning, or on August 19, 2016, Cericos again had carnal knowledge of AAA248997 by again forcibly undressing her despite her resistance, licking her vagina, and inserting his penis into her vagina (subject of Criminal Case No. 16-328297). However, AAA248997 could no longer remember if they had sexual intercourse at midday of the same day after lunch time (subject of Criminal Case No. 16-328298).[13]\n\nOn August 20, 2016, Cericos' brother arrived in the house and had a drinking session with him, with AAA248997 joining them. After the brother went home, Cericos again took advantage of the then-inebriated AAA248997 and had sexual intercourse with her against her will (subject of Criminal Case No. 16-328299).[14]\n\nMeanwhile, AAA248997's guardian, BBB248997 and sister, CCC248997, discovered at 6:00 a.m. of August 18, 2016 that the former was missing. Initially, BBB248997 and CCC248997 frantically looked for AAA248997 in their subdivision, but to no avail. After they found out that AAA248997 went to Cericos, they opened AAA248997's social media account and was able to communicate with someone related to Cericos. They were able to convince Cericos to bring AAA248997 to the barangay hall of xxxxxxxxxxx, Manila where AAA248997 was reunited with them.[15]\n\nAt the barangay hall, AAA248997 pointed to Cericos as the one who raped her, prompting barangay officials as well as police officers to take AAA248997 and Cericos to the police station for blotter and investigation purposes. AAA248997 was also taken to a Medico-Legal Officer, Dr. Riza Lorenzana, whose findings indicate \"laceration with surrounding bruise at 8 o'clock position. Anogenital findings are indicative of blunt force or penetrating trauma. Intellectual disability versus Learning disorder. Referred to a developmental pediatrician for further evaluation and management.\"[16] Thereafter, AAA248997 was referred to a development pediatrician, Dr. Stella Manalo, for developmental assessment, who then confirmed that AAA248997 is suffering from \"Intellectual Disability from mild to moderate\"[17] and has a mental age of a two (2)-year old person, taking into account the results of her examination.[18]\n\nOn cross-examination, AAA248997 admitted that: (a) Cericos is her social media boyfriend; (b) he told her to bring clothes as they will live as husband and wife and that he promised to marry her when she turns 20 years old; and (c) he did not force or threaten her to go to his house. However, on re-direct, AAA248997 clarified that while Cericos is indeed his social media boyfriend, it is different from a real-life boyfriend.[19]\n\nIn defense, Cericos invoked the defenses of denial and \"sweetheart theory.\" He maintained that AAA248997 is her girlfriend, and she asked him to fetch her in Tanay, Rizal. Upon his arrival thereat, he was surprised to see AAA248997 carrying three (3) bags full of clothes and she allegedly told him that she wanted to go with him. According to Cericos: (a) he initially refused because AAA248997's family might get mad at him, but she retorted that her family would hurt her, and thus, he made a judgment call to just bring AAA248997 to his house in xxxxxxxxxxx; (b) when they got home, he even introduced AAA248997 as his girlfriend to his siblings; (c) he and AAA248997 indeed had sexual intercourse multiple times, which the latter instigated by kissing him; and (d) he brought AAA248997 to the barangay hall because he learned that BBB248997 was planning to file a kidnapping case against him, and AAA248997 reassured him that she will execute a statement saying that she voluntarily went with him. Finally, Cericos claimed that the rape charges were merely instigated by BBB248997 because the latter disapproved of their relationship as he only earns little as a worker at a vulcanizing shop.[20]\n\nThe RTC Ruling\n\nIn a Decision[21] dated May 15, 2017, the RTC ruled as follows: (a) in Criminal Case No. 16-328295, Cericos was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, instead of Forcible Abduction with Rape, and accordingly, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and to pay AAA248997 the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) from the date of finality of the ruling until full payment; (b) in Criminal Case Nos. 16-328296, 16-328297, and 16-328299, Cericos was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, and accordingly, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each count, and to pay AAA248997 the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, all with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) from the date of finality of the ruling until full payment, for each count; and (c) in Criminal Case No. 16-328298, Cericos was acquitted on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.[22] Cericos was also ordered to pay the cost of suit in each case.\n\nIn so ruling, the RTC found that the prosecution had sufficiently established that Cericos had carnal knowledge of AAA248997 on four (4) different occasions (subject of Criminal Case Nos. 16-328295, 16-328296, 16-328297, and 16-328299), and that he used force, violence, or intimidation to achieve his criminal intent. The RTC did not lend credence to Cericos' invocation of the \"sweetheart theory,\" as AAA248997 positively testified that the repeated incidents of sexual intercourse were never consensual, as may be evinced by Cericos' acts of forcibly undressing her and inserting his penis into her vagina despite her protestations and physical resistance. According to the RTC, the finding that the incidents of sexual intercourse were not consensual is further buttressed by the fact that AAA248997 is a mental retardate, and hence, AAA248997 could not have validly consented to such incidents of sexual congress. However, as regards Criminal Case No. 16-328298, the RTC was constrained to acquit Cericos, considering that AAA248997 failed to narrate the occurrences pertaining to the purported rape incident that occurred in the midday of August 19, 2016.[23]\n\nAggrieved, Cericos appealed to the CA.\n\nThe CA Ruling\n\nIn a Decision[24] dated May 29, 2019, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling in toto. Essentially affirming the RTC's findings, the CA held that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that Cericos indeed had carnal knowledge of AAA248997 without her consent on four (4) separate occasions. The CA likewise rejected Cericos' invocation of the \"sweetheart theory\" on the ground that other than his bare testimony, there was nothing on record that would support his claim that he and AAA248997 were lovers. In this regard, the CA opined that even assuming arguendo that Cericos and AAA248997 are indeed lovers, this does not negate the commission of Rape because such fact does not give Cericos the license to have sexual intercourse with AAA248997 without her consent.[25]\n\nHence, this appeal.[26]\n\nThe Issue Before the Court\n\nThe issue before the Court is whether or not Cericos is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) counts of Rape.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe appeal is denied.\n\nArticle 266-A (1) of the RPC, as amended, reads:\nArticle 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. – Rape is committed:\n(1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:\n\n(a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;\n(b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;\n(c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and\n(d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.\nUnder this provision, \"the elements of rape are: (a) the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (b) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation; or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is under twelve years of age.\"[27]\n\nIn this case, the Court finds that both the RTC and the CA correctly ruled that through AAA248997's straightforward, credible, and trustworthy testimony, it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that Cericos indeed took her to his house, and thereat, had carnal knowledge of her on four (4) different occasions without her consent. Moreover, Cericos was able to satisfy his bestial desires in these occasions by employing force, violence, and\/or intimidation on AAA248997, as evinced by the latter's assertions that Cericos would forcefully undress her, do lewd acts to her such as kissing her breasts and licking her vagina, and finally, inserting his penis into her vagina, all despite her active protestations and physical resistance. As aptly pointed out by the RTC, such lack of consent on the part of AAA248997 is further buttressed by the fact that she is an intellectual disable having the mental age of a two (2)-year old person. Considering AAA248997's intellectual disability, \"the Court find[s] it highly improbable that she would fabricate the rape charge against [Cericos]. It is likewise unlikely that she was instructed into accusing [Cericos] given her limited intellect. Due to [AAA248997's] mental condition, only a very traumatic experience would leave a lasting impression on her so that she would be able to recall it when asked.\"[28]\n \nAs regards Cericos' invocation of \"sweetheart theory,\" suffice it to say that the CA correctly pointed out that other than his self-serving assertions, nothing in the records show that he and AAA248997 were indeed lovers. \"A 'sweetheart defense,' to be credible should be substantiated by some documentary or other evidence of relationship such as notes, gifts, pictures, mementos, and the like.\"[29]\n\nAt this juncture, it is well to clarify that the Court is aware of the rulings in People v. Castillo,[30] People v. Niebres,[31] and People v. Deniega,[32] all of which provide that sexual intercourse with an intellectual disable whose mental age is below 12 years old constitutes statutory rape, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A(1)(d) of the RPC. However, these cases are inapplicable herein, considering that in those cases, the fact of intellectual disability was duly alleged in the Information and proven at the trial; whereas in the instant case, AAA248997's intellectual disability, while proven during trial, was not duly alleged in the Informations. In fact, in People v. Quintos,[33] the Court categorically stated that the victim's mental incapacity, which was not alleged in the Information but proven at the trial is enough to prove the lack of the victim's consent to engage in sexual conduct. However, it cannot be the basis of either: (1) to qualify the rape on the ground that the accused knew of the victim's mental disability under Article 266-B (10) of the RPC; or (2) to convict the accused of Statutory Rape, such as in this case where AAA248997, who, while already 15 years of age, suffers from intellectual disability and only has the mental age of a two (2)-year old person, viz.:\nThe information charging accused of this crime lacked the allegation of any mental disability on the part of AAA. This is not necessary to convict accused of the crime of rape provided that sexual congress and mental incapacity and, therefore, the incapacity to give consent, are proved by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nHowever, to qualify the crime of rape and increase the penalty of accused from reclusion perpetua to death under Article 266-B in relation to Article 266-(A) (1) of the Revised Penal Code, an allegation of the victim's intellectual disability must be alleged in the information. If not alleged in the information, such mental incapacity may prove lack of consent but it cannot increase the penalty to death. Neither can it be the basis of conviction for statutory rape.\n\nIn this case, the elements of sexual congress and lack of consent were sufficiently alleged in the information. They were also clearly and conveniently determined during trial. The fact of being mentally incapacitated was only shown to prove AAA's incapacity to give consent, not to qualify the crime of rape.[34] (emphases and underscoring supplied)\nThus, to convict Cericos of Statutory Rape when AAA248997's intellectual disability was not duly alleged in the Informations is to violate his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, which in turn, is deeply rooted to his right to due process.[35]\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations, the Court finds no reason to overturn the courts a quo's conviction of Cericos for four (4) counts of Rape through force, violence, and\/or intimidation under Article 266-A(l)(a) of the RPC, as there was no showing that the courts a quo overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case.[36]\n\nAnent the penalties to be imposed on Cericos, the RTC and the CA correctly sentenced him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, for each count, as such sentence is in accord with Article 266-B of the RPC. Furthermore, and pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence,[37] Cericos was likewise correctly ordered to pay the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, for each count, all with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) from the date of finality of the ruling until full payment, for each count of Rape.\n\nACCORDINGLY, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated May 29, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09455 is hereby AFFIRMED. Hence, accused-appellant Eduardo Cericos, Jr. y Obiasca a.k.a. \"JR\" is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) counts of Rape, as defined and penalized under Article 266-A(l)(a), in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

{"id":153,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 207606, February 16, 2022 ]\nOFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN, PETITIONER, VS. TEODORA T. HERMOSURA, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nGAERLAN, J.:\n\nFor the Court's resolution is the present petition for review on certiorari assailing the Decision[1] dated October 23, 2012 and the Resolution[2] dated May 23, 2013 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 118223, which reversed the Decision[3] dated January 29, 2010 and Order[4] dated October 14, 2010 of the Office of the Ombudsman.\n\nThe Facts\n\nPrivate Complainant, Brenda Ortiz (Ortiz), is a businesswoman engaged in the lending business while Teodora Hermosura a.k.a. Teodora Cornelio (respondent), was employed as a Computer Operator II at the University of Makati (UMAK) until her optional retirement was approved on June 15, 2008.[5]\n\nIn 2005, the respondent initially borrowed P10,000.00 from Ortiz. The loan was renewed several times and the respondent was able to pay on time, thus, the two became friends, and Ortiz eventually engaged the respondent as an agent in her lending business.[6]\n\nAs Ortiz's agent, the respondent was to extend loans or loan accommodation to their clients at an agreed interest rate. It was also the respondent's task to look for borrowers, determine their credit standing and the amount to be lent to each of them. As part of their process, the respondent: receives the money from Ortiz in trust with the obligation to deliver them to the borrowers, collects the installments or payments from the borrowers, and finally remits the same to Ortiz. As her compensation, the respondent receives from Ortiz a commission equivalent to five percent (5%) of the total loan collected. This process worked for them for quite some time, until in 2007, when the respondent started to fail in remitting her collections.[7]\n\nOrtiz tried to contact the respondent but to no avail. Ortiz only got hold of the respondent's new phone number from an employee of UMAK. Ortiz and the respondent then met in person at a restaurant in Pasay City, where the respondent allegedly admitted that she spent the unremitted collection for her personal needs. However, she promised Ortiz that she would repay her. Subsequent to their meeting, the respondent could no longer be contacted.[8]\n\nThrough her counsel, Ortiz sent two demand letters to the respondent, warning her of the institution of legal action should she fail to return Ortiz's money in the amount of over P40,000,000.00.[9] Despite the foregoing, the respondent still failed to remit her collections. Consequently, Ortiz filed an administrative complaint for dishonesty against the respondent.\n\nIn her counter-affidavit, the respondent denied the material allegations in the complaint. She repudiated the contract of agency between her and Ortiz, and claimed that they had a business venture where she was the industrial partner and Ortiz was the capitalist. She professed that she experienced difficulties in collecting from their borrowers due to the high interest rates imposed on the loans. Also, the university\/companies imposed strict policies on salary deduction which made it difficult for her to collect from the borrowers. In another counter-affidavit, she maintained that she already remitted the sum of P65,693,770.00 to Ortiz.[10]\n\nThe Ombudsman's Decision\n\nOn January 29, 2010, the Ombudsman rendered a Decision[11] which found the respondent guilty of dishonesty. The Ombudsman rejected the respondent's contention that it has no jurisdiction over the administrative complaint considering the approval of her optional retirement on June 15, 2008, whereas the complaint was filed only on October 24, 2008.[12] The Ombudsman also observed that the respondent did not present evidence to support her claim of payment while her explanation on the difficulties she encountered in collecting from the borrowers was unsubstantiated.[13]\n\nAs regards the penalty, the Ombudsman cited Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 which provides that as a grave offense, dishonesty is punishable by dismissal for the first offense, with forfeiture of benefits except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification for re-employment in government service.[14] The decretal portion of the Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, this Office finds respondent TEODORA HERMOSURA a.k.a. TEODORA CORNELIO guilty of Dishonesty. As she had already retired from government service, she is meted the penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits and the perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service.\n\nSO ORDERED.[15]\nIn an Order[16] dated October 14, 2010, the Ombudsman denied the respondent's motion for reconsideration, which led the respondent to lodge an appeal before the CA.\n\nThe CA Decision\n\nOn October 23, 2012, the CA promulgated its Decision[17] reversing the judgment of the Ombudsman. The CA ruled that the respondent could not be held administratively liable, given that there is no proof that she availed of optional retirement to prevent the filing of an administrative complaint against her.[18] The CA expounded as follows:\nIn the case of Office of the Ombudsman vs. Andutan, Jr., the Supreme Court explained that a public official who has validly severed his\/her ties with the civil service may no longer be the subject of an administrative complaint up to his\/her deathbed, viz:\n\"To recall, we have held in the past that a public official's resignation does not render moot an administrative case that was filed prior to the official's resignation. In Pagano v. Nazarro, Jr., we held that:\nIn Office of the Court Administrator v. Juan [A.M. No. P-03-1726, 22 July 2004, 434 SCRA 654, 658], this Court categorically ruled that the precipitate resignation of a government employee charged with an offense punishable by dismissal from the service does not render moot the administrative case against him. Resignation is not a way out to evade administrative liability when facing administrative sanction. The resignation of a public servant does not preclude the finding of any administrative liability to which be or she shall still be answerable [Baquerfo v. Sanchez, A.M. No. P-05-1974, 6 April 2005, 455 SCRA 13, 19-20]\n\nLikewise, in Baquerfo v. Sanchez, we held:\n\nCessation from office of respondent by resignation [Reyes v. Cristi, A.M. No. P-04-1801, 2 April 2004, 427 SCRA 8] or retirement [Re: Complaint Filed by Atty. Francis Allan A. Rubio on the Alleged Falsification of Public Documents and Malversation of Public Funds, A.M. No. 2004-17-SC, 27 September 2004] neither warrants the dismissal of the administrative complaint filed against him while he was still in the service [Tuliao v. Ramos, A.M. No. MTJ-95-1065, 348 Phil. 404, 416 (1998), citing Perez v. Abiera, A.C. No. 223-J, 11 June 1975, 64 SCRA 302; Secretary of Justice v. Marcos, A.C. No. 207-J, 22 April 1977, 76 SCRA 301] nor does it render said administrative case moot and academic [Sy Bang v. Mendez, 350 Phil. 524, 533 (1998)]. The jurisdiction that was this Court's at the time of filing of the administrative complaint was not lost by the mere fact that the respondent public official had ceased in office during the pendency of his case [Flores v. Sumaljag, 353 Phil. 10, 21 (1998)]. Respondent's resignation does not preclude the finding of any administrative liability to which he shall still be answerable [OCA v. Fernandez, A.M. No. MTJ-03-1511, 20 August 2004].\nHowever, the facts of those cases are not entirely applicable to the present case. In the above-cited cases, the Court found that the public officials - subject of the administrative cases – resigned, either to prevent the continuation of a case already filed or to pre-empt the imminent filing of one. Here, neither situation obtains.\n\nx x x x\n\nWhile we commend the Ombudsman's resolve in pursuing the present case for violations allegedly committed by Andutan, the Court is compelled to uphold the law and dismiss the petition. Consistent with our holding that Andutan is no longer the proper subject of an administrative complaint, we find no reason to delve on the Ombudsman's factual findings.\n\nWHEREFORE, we DENY the Office of the Ombudsman's petition for review on certiorari, and AFFIRM the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 68893, promulgated on July 28, 2004, which annulled and set aside the July 30, 2001 decision of the Office of the Ombudsman, finding Uldarico P. Andutan, Jr. guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty. (Emphasis supplied)\nAfter a careful and judicious review of the records of this case, We find no evidence on record showing that the petitioner only availed of her optional retirement in order to pre-empt the imminent filing of the administrative case against her. Absent proof to the contrary, petitioner's retirement from the civil service is deemed bona fide which renders her an ineligible subject of an administrative investigation. Thus, the public respondent committed a reversible error when it did not dismiss the administrative complaint filed by the private respondent against herein petitioner, considering that the latter had already validly severed her ties with the civil service several months before the filing of the aforesaid complaint.\n\nx x x x[19]\nIn conclusion, the CA disposed of the case as follows:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Decision and Order of the honorable public respondent, finding petitioner Teodora T. Hermosura, guilty of Dishonesty, are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.\n\nSO ORDERED.[20]\nThe CA likewise denied the Ombudsman's motion for reconsideration in its Resolution[21] dated May 23, 2013.\n\nThus, the Ombudsman filed the present petition. In her Comment,[22] the respondent submits that the Ombudsman failed to establish that her retirement was aimed at pre-empting the imminent filing of the administrative case against her. Thus, the presumption is that her retirement is considered valid and lawful.[23] She further contends that pursuant to the Court's ruling in Office of the Ombudsman v. Andutan, Jr. (Andutan),[24] \"she may no longer be the subject of an administrative complaint up to her deathbed.\"[25] Rebutting the respondent's arguments, the Ombudsman, in its Reply,[26] raised the fact that the respondent's severance from the government service prior to the filing of the complaint was due to her availment of optional retirement, after Ortiz informed her, through demand letters, that cases would be filed against her in case of non-payment of her obligation.[27]\n\nEssentially, the issues are: 1.) Whether the Ombudsman should not have taken cognizance of the complaint against the respondent in view of her retirement from the government service; and 2.) Whether the respondent should be held administratively liable for the charge against her.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n \nRespondent can still be held administratively liable as her retirement was voluntary\n \n\nIn Office of the Court Administrator v. Juan,[28] a public officer tendered his resignation a day after he confessed to the commission of an administrative offense. Holding that the respondent's resignation does not render the case moot, the Court ruled that \"resignation is not a way out to evade administrative liability when a court personnel is facing administrative sanction.\"[29]\n\nThe Court reiterated the same principle in a case[30] where a public officer filed her resignation prior to the date she was set to appear for a formal investigation, to wit:\nx x x we view respondent's act of filing her resignation before the investigation as indicative of her guilt. Indeed, an employee's act of tendering her resignation immediately after the discovery of the anomalous transaction is indicative of her guilt as flight in criminal cases. And, resignation is not a way out to evade administrative liability when a court employee is facing administrative sanction.[31]\nHere, in holding that the respondent cannot be held administratively charged for dishonesty in view of the absence of proof that she applied for optional retirement to pre-empt the imminent filing of the administrative complaint against her, the CA applied, albeit erroneously, the Court's pronouncements in Andutan.\n\nIndeed, in Andutan, the Court dismissed the administrative case against Andutan, which was filed one year and two months after his resignation. The Court ruled that \"the Ombudsman can no longer institute an administrative case against Andutan because the latter was not a public servant at the time the case was filed.\" However this was decided in light of the circumstances obtaining in Andutan:\nThe Ombudsman's general assertion that Andutan pre-empted the filing of a case against him by resigning, since he \"knew for certain that the investigative and disciplinary arms of the State would eventually reach him\" is unfounded. First, Andutan's resignation was neither his choice nor of his own doing; he was forced to resign. Second, Andutan resigned from his DOF post on July 1, 1998, while the administrative case was filed on September 1, 1999, exactly one (1) year and two (2) months after his resignation. The Court struggles to find reason in the Ombudsman's sweeping assertions in light of these facts.\n\nWhat is clear from the records is that Andutan was forced to resign more than a year before the Ombudsman filed the administrative case against him. Additionally, even if we were to accept the Ombudsman's position that Andutan foresaw the filing of the case against him, his forced resignation negates the claim that he tried to prevent the filing of the administrative case.[32]\nTo emphasize, Andutan's resignation from the government service was not voluntary, as he was merely forced to resign. Therefore, whether he knew that a case would be filed against him or not is immaterial – what is certain is that, he could not have resigned with the purpose of pre-empting the filing of administrative case against him.\n\nIn the present case, it is undisputed that the respondent availed of optional retirement after Ortiz's counsel sent her letters, which informed her of the possibility of the institution of legal action against her should she fail to settle her obligation. Verily, a complaint was filed against her four months after her optional retirement. This is in huge contrast with Andutan, who was forced to resign from his post. Thus, Andutan cannot be applied to respondent's case. The respondent's voluntary separation from the government service, in addition to her knowledge that a complaint would most likely be filed against her at anytime, bolsters the Ombudsman's position that the respondent attempted to\nforestall the filing of an administrative case against her by availing of optional retirement.\n\nThe foregoing also finds support in Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas v. Office of the Ombudsman and Jamorabo,[33] where the Court arrived at a similar conclusion:\nGiven the suspicious timing and the circumstances surrounding his voluntary retirement from the service, coupled with his actual departure from the Philippines in April 2010, barely four months after the loan was finally settled by his wife and sister-in-law, this Court finds that Jamorabo's voluntary separation from government service was calculated to pre-empt the charges that will inevitably result from the discovery of the illicit loan he entered into. As it turned out, RBKSI did report the loan to the BSP in the very next examination period; and the complaint against Jamorabo was filed shortly thereafter.[34]\nCertainly, the respondent's voluntary severance from the government service is not a bar to the filing of an administrative case against her given that the surrounding circumstances of her optional retirement reveal that it was availed of to avert impending administrative charges concerning her unfulfilled obligation. \n \nRespondent is administratively liable for Simple Dishonesty\n \n\nCivil Service Commission (CSC) Resolution No. 06-0538 or the Rules on the Administrative Offense of Dishonesty defines dishonesty as \"the concealment of truth, which shows lack of integrity or a disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive or betray and an intent to violate the truth.\"[35] This Resolution was issued \"to provide a classification for the offense of Dishonesty to impose the corresponding penalty based on the circumstances of the case.\"[36] Thus, dishonesty is classified as serious, less serious, or simple.\n\nFor dishonesty to be considered serious, the presence of any of the following circumstances is necessary:\na. The dishonest act caused serious damage and grave prejudice to the Government;\n\nb. The respondent gravely abused his authority in order to commit the dishonest act;\n\nc. Where the respondent is an accountable officer, the dishonest act directly involves property, accountable forms or money for which he is directly accountable and the respondent shows an intent to commit material gain, graft and corruption;\n\nd. The dishonest act exhibits moral depravity on the part of the respondent;\n\ne. The respondent employed fraud and\/or falsification of official documents in the commission of the dishonest act related to his\/her employment;\n\nf. The dishonest act was committed several times or various occasions;\n\ng. The dishonest act involves a Civil Service examination irregularity or fake Civil Service eligibility such as, but not limited to impersonation, cheating and use of crib sheets;\n\nh. Other analogous circumstances. x x x[37]\nDishonesty is less serious under any of the following circumstances:\na. The dishonest act caused damage and prejudice to the government, which is not so serious as to qualify under the immediately preceding classification.\n\nb. The respondent did not take advantage of his\/her position in committing the dishonest act.\n\nc. Other analogous circumstances.[38]\nLastly, if any one of the following circumstances is present, dishonesty is classified as simple:\na. The dishonest act did not cause damage or prejudice to the government.\n\nb. The dishonest act has no direct relation to or does not involve the duties and responsibilities of the respondent.\n\nc. In falsification of any official document, where the information falsified is not related to his\/her employment.\n\nd. That the dishonest act did not result in any gain or benefit to the offender.\n\ne. Other analogous circumstances.[39]\nIn this case, the Ombudsman found the respondent guilty of dishonesty for which she was meted the penalty of forfeiture of retirement benefits along with perpetual disqualification from government employment. Indeed, the respondent's act of not remitting her collections to Ortiz and evading the latter constitute dishonesty. The respondent could have simply forwarded the names of the defaulting borrowers to Ortiz if she was in fact having difficulty collecting payment from them. Aside from her bare allegations, she did not present any proof regarding the borrowers' unpaid loans.\n\nNonetheless, the Court finds that none of the circumstances provided in the case of serious dishonesty obtains in the case at bar. The respondent's act, although dishonest, did not cause serious damage or grave prejudice to the government, nor was it committed in relation to or in connection with her duties. Thus, the respondent is administratively guilty of simple dishonesty only.\n\nSimple dishonesty is punishable by suspension of one month and one day to six months for the first offense.[40] Considering that the respondent has already voluntarily retired from the government service, the forfeiture of six months' salary to be deducted from the respondent's retirement benefits is sufficient penalty.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision dated October 23, 2012 and the Resolution dated May 23, 2013 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

{"id":154,"text":"SECOND DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 257276, February 28, 2022 ]\nPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. XXX[1] ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nHERNANDO, J.:\n\nThis resolves the appeal[2] filed by accused-appellant XXX (accused-appellant) assailing the November 25, 2020 Decision[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB CR. HC. No. 03295. Accused-appellant was charged with Qualified Rape under the following Information:\nThat on or about the 8th day of August 2009 in the xxxxxxxxxxx,[4] and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with [AAA],[5] a minor 7 years old (sic) aggravated by relationship, the accused being the uncle of the victim because accused is the brother of the victim's father.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.[6]\nAccused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge against him.[7] The defense admitted the authenticity and due execution of complainant AAA's temporary medical certificate. The said document, along with AAA's baptismal certificate and birth certificate, was admitted as documentary evidence.[8] The prosecution presented the testimonies of AAA, her mother BBB, and Dr. Rufina Leonor Barrot Gler (Dr. Gler). The records of the stenographic notes of the said witnesses were lost due to the onslaught of Typhoon Yolanda; thus, the retaking of testimonies of the said witnesses was conducted, except for Dr. Gler's.[9] However, the defense admitted the authenticity and due execution of the temporary medical report and final medico-legal report.[10]\n\nVersion of the prosecution:\n\nAAA recounted that at around 7:00 p.m. of August 8, 2009, she was inside their house when accused-appellant, her uncle who lived with them, summoned her inside his room. Upon entering accused-appellant's room, accused-appellant pulled down her shirt, removed her panty, and undressed himself by removing his pants, brief, and t-shirt. Accused-appellant proceeded to kiss AAA on the lips, then laid her down on the bed. He subsequently mounted AAA and inserted his penis inside her vagina.[11] The latter felt pain in her vagina and informed accused-appellant about it, which caused him to stop his actions. Accused-appellant stood up, put on his clothes and directed AAA to do the same. She put on her clothes and both of them then sat on the bed side by side. At this point, accused-appellant unzipped his pants and ordered AAA to suck his penis. Due to his threat that he will kill her if she does not comply with his orders, AAA followed his order. After 30 minutes of satisfying his desires, accused-appellant told her to get out of his room.[12] AAA was only seven years old at the time of the incident.[13] She further testified that accused-appellant also raped her prior to the incident.[14]\n\nOn the same night, BBB was grilling fish inside their house and called for AAA to help her. However, she did not reply. BBB went out to look for her daughter. While BBB was passing through accused-appellant's window, she saw that accused-appellant was kissing her daughter and that her daughter was holding accused-appellant's penis, running her fingers on it in an up and down motion.[15] BBB rushed to enter her house and saw her daughter coming out of accused-appellant's room. Upon seeing her mother, AAA informed her that accused-appellant sexually abused her and threatened to kill her if she does not follow his orders. Upon hearing this, BBB informed her husband, and they immediately proceeded to the xxxxxxxxxxx Police Community Precinct to report the rape incident against accused-appellant. After reporting the incident, they brought AAA to the hospital to undergo a medical examination.[16]\n\nDr. Florence J. Curbilla, the gynecologist who examined AAA, discovered that there was an abrasion on the labia majora and an old healed incomplete hymenal laceration at the 11:00 o'clock position, but her vaginal discharge did not contain any spermatozoa. Dr. Curbilla's findings were contained in the medico-legal report.[17]\n\nVersion of the Defense:\n\nFor his part, accused-appellant denied having raped AAA and claimed that he was sleeping in his house at the time of the incident. His house was adjacent to the house of AAA. While he was sleeping, two police officers went to his house, awakened him, and informed him that someone has complained that he committed rape. BBB accompanied the police officers.[18] He admitted that he was AAA's uncle, since her father is his brother.[19] While he noted that the only possible motive against him is a land dispute between the siblings, he stated that he was very close to AAA's parents, who treated him well and had no reason to charge him with sexual abuse.[20]\n\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court (RTC):\n\nOn February 20, 2019, the RTC, Branch 7 of xxxxxxxxxxx, convicted accused-appellant of Qualified Rape. The RTC accorded great weight to the victim's straightforward and positive testimony, which was corroborated by BBB's testimony, over accused-appellant's negative and self-serving account.[21] The RTC also noted that the fact that the victim was only seven years old at the time of the incident and that the accused-appellant is her uncle was sufficiently proven.[22] The fallo of the RTC's judgment reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused [XXX] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Rape. He is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole and to pay the private offended party \"AAA\" P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, with all such amounts to earn interest of 6% per annum from the finality of this decision until full payment.\n\nx x x x\n\nSO ORDERED.[23]\nIn his appeal, accused-appellant decried the RTC's finding of guilt, and argued that the RTC erred in giving weight and credence to the testimony of AAA. Accused-appellant argued that there are glaring inconsistencies in AAA's and BBB's testimonies, noting further that BBB's supposed reaction of not rushing to the aid of her daughter in a dreadful situation is incredulous. Accused-appellant likewise maintained that his relationship to AAA was not duly proven.[24] On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General averred that accused-appellant's guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and maintained that the complainant's credible and straightforward testimony must prevail over the bare denials of the accused-appellant. [25]\n\nRuling of the Court of Appeals:\n\nIn its November 25, 2020 Decision, the CA modified the designation of the crime committed from Qualified Rape to Statutory Rape. The CA agreed that the prosecution sufficiently established AAA's minority at the time of the incident and the presence of the elements of Statutory Rape, and that AAA's clear and convincing testimony deserves full weight and credence. However, the CA observed that the allegation of relationship between AAA and accused-appellant under the Information is insufficient under prevailing jurisprudence.[26] The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Judgment dated 20 February 2019 of the Regional Trial Court of xxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, Branch 7, in Criminal Case No. 2009-08-363 finding accused-appellant [XXX] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of statutory rape is AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION. [XXX] is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages.\n\nThe award of damages must earn 6% per annum computed from finality of the Court's Decision until satisfied.\n\nSO ORDERED.[27]\nHence, this appeal.[28]\n\nOur Ruling\n\nAfter a careful review of the records, the Court holds that the appeal is bereft of merit.\n\nIn the review of rape cases, We continue to be guided by the following principles: (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility, it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant is scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense. Thus, in a prosecution for rape, the complainant's credibility becomes the single most important issue.[29]\n\nConsidering the foregoing, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the courts a quo that the elements of Statutory Rape were duly established. AAA's straightforward and positive testimony that accused-appellant raped her was corroborated by BBB's testimony. When considered together with the medico-legal certificate indicating an abrasion on her labia majora and AAA's birth certificate proving that she was seven years old at the time of the incident, the prosecution's evidence is sufficient for conviction. It is settled that the crime of rape is deemed consummated even when the man's penis merely enters or comes into contact to the labia or lips of the female organ.[30] Further, the trial court's assessment on the credibility of witnesses deserves great weight, and even conclusive and binding effect, unless the same is tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence, since the trial court is in a better position than the appellate court to properly evaluate testimonial evidence. The rule finds an even more stringent application where the CA sustained said findings, as in this case.[31]\n\nMoreover, AAA's testimony is clear, candid, consistent in its material points, and unshaken during cross-examination. When the offended party is of tender age and immature, courts are inclined to give credit to her account of what transpired, considering not only her relative vulnerability, but also the shame to which she would be exposed if the matter to which she testified is not true.[32] Thus, accused-appellant's defense of denial cannot overcome the categorical testimony of the victim. Denial is an intrinsically weak defense which must be buttressed with strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility. A denial, which necessarily constitutes self-serving negative evidence, cannot prevail over the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.[33]\n\nHowever, contrary to the finding of the CA, We hold that the special qualifying circumstance of relationship was sufficiently alleged in the Information. Indeed, the minority of the victim and his or her relationship with the offender should both be alleged in the Information and proven beyond reasonable doubt during trial in order to qualify the rape charge as these circumstances have the effect of altering the nature of the rape and its corresponding penalty.[34] If the offender is merely a relation — not a parent, ascendant, step-parent, or guardian or common-law spouse of the mother of the victim — it must be alleged in the information that he is \"a relative by 'consanguinity or affinity (as the case may be) within the third civil degree.\" The allegation that accused-appellant is the uncle of AAA, and a brother of AAA's father, without specifically alleging that such relationship was within the third civil degree, is specific enough to satisfy the special qualifying circumstance of relationship.[35] In People v. XXX,[36] the Court considered the qualifying circumstance of relationship even without the specific allegation that the same was within the third civil degree of consanguinity or affinity, since the information therein already described the offender as the \"maternal uncle\" of the victim. In the same manner, the Information in the instant case contained a statement that \"the accused being the uncle of victim because accused is the brother of the victim's father.\"[37] Hence, accused-appellant can be properly convicted of Qualified Rape.\n\nIn sum, accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Rape. Thus, he was properly meted out the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole.[38] The CA's awards of P75,000.00 each as civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages are increased to P100,000.00 each to conform to prevailing jurisprudence.[39] All damages awarded shall earn six percent (6%) interest per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment.\n\nWHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The November 25, 2020 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CEB CR. HC. No. 03295 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that accused-appellant XXX is found GUILTY of Qualified Rape and sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. He is ordered to pay AAA (i) P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, (ii) P100,000.00 as moral damages, and (iii) P100,000.00 as exemplary damages. Interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum shall be imposed on the aggregate amount of the monetary awards computed from the finality of this Decision until full payment.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPerlas-Bernabe, (Chairperson), Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.\n","label":[[18,33,"CASE_NUM"],[35,52,"PROM_DATE"],[55,80,"INS"],[149,161,"PERSON"],[294,310,"INS"],[312,314,"INS"],[319,348,"CASE_NUM"],[546,551,"INS"],[1218,1243,"PERSON"],[1249,1253,"PERSON"],[1453,1457,"PERSON"],[3549,3574,"INS"],[3736,3756,"PERSON"],[3993,4001,"PERSON"],[4760,4780,"INS"],[4782,4785,"INS"],[4815,4818,"INS"],[4896,4899,"INS"],[5089,5092,"INS"],[5277,5280,"INS"],[5870,5873,"INS"],[5914,5917,"INS"],[6316,6347,"INS"],[6586,6602,"INS"],[6644,6646,"INS"],[6738,6740,"INS"],[6983,6985,"INS"],[7170,7172,"INS"],[7270,7290,"INS"],[7333,7362,"CASE_NUM"],[7740,7745,"INS"],[7871,7876,"INS"],[8605,8610,"INS"],[9692,9694,"INS"],[10576,10578,"INS"],[11558,11571,"CASE_NUM"],[11581,11586,"INS"],[12295,12297,"INS"],[12666,12682,"INS"],[12686,12715,"CASE_NUM"],[13237,13251,"PERSON"],[13268,13276,"PERSON"],[13278,13285,"PERSON"],[13291,13298,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}

ROMEO DALUSONG AND\/OR MARITIME MANAGEMENT SERVICES, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nHERNANDO, J.:\n\nThis petition for review on certiorari[1] seeks to annul and set aside the January 23, 2015 Decision[2] and July 20, 2015 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 126155, which affirmed the April 26, 2012 Decision[4] and June 18, 2012 Resolution[5] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC LAC No. (OFW-M) 10-000897-11.\n\nThe Antecedents:\n\nPetitioner Reynaldo P. Cabatan (Cabatan) was employed as an oiler by Southeast Asia Shipping Corp. (SEASCORP) on behalf of its principal, Maritime Management Services (Maritime Management) from 2006 to 2010.[6] Before deployment, he underwent his Pre-Employment Medical Examination (PEME) and was certified to be fit for sea duty.[7] On January 30, 2010, he boarded M\/V BP Pioneer under a three month contract.[8]\n\nOn March 29, 2010, while Cabatan was on his 12-hour duty, the spare parts assigned to one of the generators he was tasked to repair were delivered. He carried the spare parts along with a heavy connecting rod. At that point, the vessel, which had a restricted alley, suddenly swayed due to the big waves. This caused Cabatan to bend and nearly fall to his knees. Then, he felt excruciating pain in his scrotal\/inguinal area. Despite feeling pain and numbness in his left leg all the way down, he continued to carry the parts and repaired the generator until he was relieved by another oiler.[9]\n\nAfter his duty, Cabatan went to his cabin and took a pain reliever. Shortly after, he went to the ship's clinic to have himself checked by the doctor on board. In the Report of Illness[10] by the ship's doctor, the latter advised him to rest until further observation since it may just be due to tiredness. Furthermore, the doctor ruled out hernia and trauma.[11]\n\nOn May 19, 2010, Cabatan was re-examined by the doctor. He still felt pain during prolonged standing or while walking, with numbness of his lower extremity. However, the doctor concluded that this was normal considering his age and was just advised to take pain relievers.[12]\n\nUpon expiration of his contract on May 25, 2010, Cabatan disembarked the vessel at the port of Takoradi, Ghana and was repatriated back to the Philippines. Believing that the pain in his scrotal\/inguinal area was normal and, as the doctor had advised, he took a complete rest for about a month.[13]\n\nEventually, SEASCORP called him for possible deployment. He was sent to Merita Diagnostic Clinic (Merita), the company-accredited clinic, for his PEME. During his examination, Cabatan informed the doctor about the injury sustained while on board. Thus, the doctor asked him to get an x-ray of his scrotal\/inguinal area and lumbar spine.[14]\n\nOn July 2, 2010, Merita reported the following findings\/recommendations regarding Cabatan's examination:\nNOTED: PERINEAL PAIN (WHILE WALKING)\nEXTENDING TO MEDIAL ASPECT OF BOTH THIGH\n*LUMBO SACRAL X-RAY RESULT:\n     RETROLESTHESES L2 OVER L3\n     OSTEODEGENERATIVE CHANGES LS\n     SACRALIZATION OF L5\nORTHOPAEDIC SURGEON ASSESSMENT:\n     TO CONSIDER NERVE ROOT COMPRESSION\n     FOR EMG NCV OF LOWER EXTREMITIES AND MRI OF\n     LUMBOSACRAL\nOTHER REMARKS:\n     GENITALS (+) PENILE IMPLANT RULE OUT\n     BULGING MASS – CLEARED BY SURGEON\n     HYPERTENSION CONTROLLED WITH\n     MAINTENANCE: MICARDS PLUS 40 MG\n     ONCE DAILY[15]\nOn July 30, 2010, Cabatan also underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Lumbo-Sacral Spine. The findings were as follows:\nCentral canal and bilateral neural foraminal stenosis, L4-L5 and L5-S1, secondary to posterior disc protrusion, ligamentum flaval thickening and facet arthropathy.\nDisc bulging, L2-L3 and L3-L4.\nLumbar osteophytes with disc desiccations.\nPosterior annular tears, L4-L5 and L5-S1.\nGrade I spondylolisthesis, L4\/L5.\nSubcutaneous cyst, left posterior wall of lumbar spine.\n\nx x x x[16]\nHe also underwent EMG NCV which yielded the following results:\nInterpretation:\n\nToday's electrodiagnostic examination revealed findings compatible with a mild chronic lumbar radiculopathy involving the L4-5 and L5-S1 spinal roots. Kindly correlate clinically.\n\nx x x x [17]\nCabatan further consulted Dr. Detabali of the De los Santos Hospital who advised him to have L4-S1 Laminectomy and L4-L5 Instrumented Posterolateral Fusion. Due to the costly price of the procedures, Cabatan asked for financial assistance from SEASCORP through its crewing manager, Mr. Aguinaldo, considering that he sustained his injury during his employment. Mr. Aguinaldo promised to relay the request to its principal, Maritime Management, but the request was left unheeded.[18]\n\nOn August 26, 2010, Cabatan also consulted Dr. David M. Cabatan, Jr. (Dr. Cabatan), an orthopedic and spine surgeon, who made the following findings:\nDIAGNOSIS: SPINAL STENOSIS L4-L5 AND L5-S1\nGRADE 1 SPONDYLOLISTHESIS, L4-L5\n\nMr. Reynaldo P. Cabatan is a 54 year old male, seaman, who first consulted the undersigned on August 20, 2010. He complained of greatly diminished standing and walking tolerance secondary to low back pain radiating down the lower extremities of about 6 months duration. This was left sided worse than right and was aggravated by 15 minutes of standing or walking. There was accompanying numbness and paresthesias of the lower extremities. Mr. Cabatan has been on medication and physiotherapy without apparent relief of his symptoms.\n\nOn physical examination, Mr. Cabatan walked into the office bent forward and with a limp. There was reproduction of his pain with low back extension and left lateral flexion. He was able to walk on tiptoe and on heels without any difficulty. Trendelenburg test was negative. Nerve root tension signs were absent and Patrick's test was negative. Manual muscle testing revealed no more deficits.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbosacral spine revealed a grade 1 spondylolisthesis at L4-L5 causing moderate to severe spinal stenosis. There also were spondylotic changes at L5-S1 and L2-L3 causing mild to moderate stenosis.\n\nMr. Cabatan has been advised surgical decompression of this spinal stenosis as symptoms have become quite disabling. The planned procedure as a laminectomy from L4-S1 and posterolateral instrumented fusion at L4-L5 due to the spondylisthesis. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed. He is to have a medical and cardiac clearance prior to the surgery.\n\nx x x x[19]\nDr. Cabatan also estimated the total surgery cost amounting to P473,000.00.[20]\n\nOn March 1, 2011, Cabatan filed a complaint[21] against the respondents for permanent and total disability benefits.[22]\n\nOn the other hand, respondents maintained that during Cabatan's last employment contract, he underwent PEME and was certified fit for sea duty.[23] Upon completion of his contract on May 25, 2010, Cabatan disembarked the vessel. When he arrived in Manila, Cabatan did not report to the manning agency for the mandatory post-employment medical examination, nor request for medical assistance for any injury or illness.[24]\n\nAfter almost a year following the termination of his contract, Cabatan suddenly filed a complaint against respondents before the NLRC and claimed for total and permanent disability benefits, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.[25]\n\nRuling of the Labor Arbiter (LA):\n\nIn its August 31, 2011 Decision,[26] the LA ruled in favor of Cabatan. The dispositive portion thereof reads:\nWHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, respondents Southeast Asia Shipping Corp. and Maritime Management Services, Inc. are hereby directed to pay complainant Reynaldo P. Cabatan, jointly and severally, his permanent and total disability compensation equivalent to $60,000.00 plus attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total judgment award.\n\nAll other claims are hereby ordered dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED.[27] (Emphasis in the original)\nThe LA found that Cabatan suffered an injury while performing his duties as an oiler. Being a work-related injury, it held that it must be compensable. As to respondents' contention of Cabatan's failure to comply with the mandatory three-day reporting requirement for a post-employment examination, it found the same untenable. Cabatan was repatriated not because of a medical condition but due to the expiration of his contract. Thus, the three-day mandatory reporting requirement under Section 20 (B) (2) and (3) of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA SEC) did not apply in Cabatan's case.[28]\n\nRuling of the National Labor Relations Commission:\n\nAggrieved, respondents filed an appeal[29] before the NLRC. They argued that Cabatan failed to prove that he suffered a work-related injury during the term of his employment which rendered him permanently and totally disabled. There was no accident on board as the Report of Illness reveals that Cabatan experienced scrotal\/inguinal discomfort while lifting a heavy object. Moreover, while he complained of scrotal\/inguinal discomfort, Cabatan is claiming for disability compensation for an alleged injury on his back and\/or spinal region.\n\nRespondents also pointed out that if Cabatan was really suffering from an illness\/injury, he should have sought medical assistance immediately upon repatriation and that he was not really repatriated due to medical reasons. Lastly, Cabatan's failure to report to the company-physician within three days from arrival for post-employment examination bars him from claiming any disability benefits.\n\nIn its April 26, 2012 Decision,[30] the NLRC reversed and set aside the LA's Decision and dismissed Cabatan's claim for disability benefits for lack of merit. It found Cabatan's assertion, that he suffered an injury while on board and felt pain on his left leg to his foot, unsupported by evidence. What was reflected on record is the discomfort on his scrotal and inguinal area. Moreover, a seafarer who claims to be medically infirm must be examined by the company-designated physician within three days from repatriation. Thus, Cabatan's failure to report within the mandatory period without justifiable cause resulted in the forfeiture of his right to claim compensation and disability benefits under the POEA-SEC.\n\nCabatan filed a motion for reconsideration[31] which was later denied by the NLRC in its June 18, 2012 Resolution.[32]\n\nRuling of the Court of Appeals:\n\nAggrieved, Cabatan filed a petition for certiorari[33] before the CA. In his petition, Cabatan averred that Section 20(B)(3) which requires the three-day mandatory reporting requirement only covers seafarers who are medically repatriated. Since he was repatriated due to the completion of his contract, he is entitled to permanent and total disability benefits upon the company-accredited clinic's finding that he was unfit for sea duty. The controlling factor in claiming disability benefits is that the seafarer suffers a work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract. Thus, his failure to report to the company-designated physician for post-employment examination shall not bar him from claiming disability benefits.[34]\n\nCabatan also claimed that he substantially proved the injury in his scrotal and inguinal area through the Report of Illness by the ship doctor which stated that he experienced pain while lifting a heavy object during the performance of his duties as an oiler. However, since the ship doctor did not recommend him for medical attention, Cabatan explained that he no longer went to the company-designated physician for a post-employment medical examination. He only found out about his disability when the company-designated physician eventually declared him to be unfit for sea duty. Consequently, his disability became permanent and total.\n\nIn its January 23, 2015 Decision,[35] the CA denied Cabatan's appeal. It held that Cabatan's failure to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement resulted in the forfeiture of his right to claim compensation and benefits for injury or illness. The fallo of the CA's judgment reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED.[36]\nDiscontented, Cabatan filed a Motion for Reconsideration[37] but it was later denied by the CA in its July 20, 2015 Resolution.[38]\n\nIssue\n\nHence, the present petition for review on certiorari raising the following errors:\nThe Honorable Court of Appeals blatantly erred when it failed to consider the \"REPORT OF ILLNESS\" of the Ship's doctor indicating that petitioner's illness of \"Spondylolisthesis\" was contracted during the petitioner's term of employment with respondents.\n\nThe Honorable Court of Appeals seriously erred when it ruled that the 3-day reporting requirement under Section 20 (B) paragraph 3 of the 2000 POEA-SEC is an absolute rule, contrary to existing jurisprudence.\n\nPetitioner is entitled to disability compensation for the injury\/illness suffered during the term of his employment with respondents pursuant to Section 20 (B) paragraph 6 of the 2000 POEA-SEC, thus, he is entitled to permanent total disability under the Labor Code concept of permanent total disability consistently applied by the Honorable Supreme Court to Filipino seamen on-board ocean-going vessels. Likewise, petitioner is entitled to 10% of the award for and as attorney's fees.[39]\nOur Ruling\n\nThe petition is without merit.\n\nGenerally, a petition for review under Rule 45 is only limited to questions of law since the Court is not a trier of facts and it is beyond its function to evaluate the evidence already considered in the proceedings below.[40] One of the recognized exceptions is when the findings of the LA and NLRC on one hand, and the CA, on the other, are conflicting. Such is the case at bar. Thus, in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, this Court is compelled to re-evaluate the factual issues and re-examine the questioned findings.[41]\n\nIt is undisputed that Cabatan's employment contract with SEASCORP executed on January 30, 2010 is governed by the 2000 Amended Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Overseas Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Ships (2000 POEA-SEC). Paragraph 3, Section 20 (B) thereof regarding disability benefits provides:\nB. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS. — The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract are as follows:\n\nx x x x\n\n3. Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work by the company-designated physician or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case shall it exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.\n\nFor this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance. Failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nx x x x\nThus, in order to claim compensability under the forgoing section, it is required that the seafarer must have: (1) suffered a work-related illness or injury during the term of his contract; and (2) submitted himself to a mandatory post-employment medical examination within three (3) working days upon his arrival. As explained in Jebsens Maritime, Inc. v. Undag,[42] the purpose of the three-day mandatory reporting requirement is to enable the company-designated physician to ascertain if the seafarer's injury or illness is work-related, viz.:\nThe rationale behind the rule can easily be divined. Within three days from repatriation, it would be fairly easier for a physician to determine if the illness was work-related or not. After that period, there would be difficulty in ascertaining the real cause of the illness.\n\nTo ignore the rule would set a precedent with negative repercussions because it would open the floodgates to a limitless number of seafarers claiming disability benefits. It would certainly be unfair to the employer who would have difficulty determining the cause of a claimant's illness considering the passage of time. In such a case, the employers would have no protection against unrelated disability claims.[43]\nThe same doctrine was applied in Wallem Maritime Services, Inc. v. Tanawan[44] (Wallem), InterOrient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v. Creer III[45] (InterOrient), Scanmar Maritime Services, Inc. v. De Leon[46] (Scanmar), and Manila Shipmanagement & Manning, Inc. v. Aninang[47] (Manila).\n\nIn Wallem,[48] the seafarer was repatriated due to a foot injury and was examined by the company physician within the three-day reporting requirement; however he claimed for disability benefits for both foot and eye injuries. Under such facts, the Court denied his claim for disability benefits due to the eye injury for his failure to report the same to the company physician within three days from repatriation.\n\nIn InterOrient[49] and Scanmar,[50] the mariner also failed to submit himself to a post-employment medical examination within three days from disembarkation. The Court held that non-compliance with the three-day reporting requirement bars his claim for disability benefits.\n\nIn Manila,[51] We also denied the seafarer's claim for disability benefits absent any showing that he presented himself before the company three days upon disembarkation. This Court further clarified that the fact that a seafarer was not repatriated for medical reasons will not exempt him from compliance with the mandatory three-day reporting requirement.\n\nAs pointed out by Cabatan, the three-day mandatory reporting requirement is not absolute. In Wallem Maritime Services v. National Labor Relations Commission,[52] the Court explained that if the seafarer is physically incapacitated from complying with the requirement for being terminally ill and is in need of immediate medical attention, the mandatory reporting period may be dispensed with.\n\nHowever, the three-day reporting requirement is not absolute as correctly pointed out by Cabatan. Paragraph 3, Section 20 (B) of the POEA-SEC also provides that a seafarer who is physically incapacitated to report for a post-employment examination may send a written notice to its agency within the same period. In Status Maritime Corp. v. Spouses Delalamon,[53] We recognized the deteriorating condition of the seafarer who cannot be reasonably expected to report to his employer's office considering the physical strain caused by his illness. Moreover, the employer was already notified of the failing health condition of the seafarer upon finding out he was diagnosed with a serious illness abroad.\n\nBased on the foregoing, Cabatan's claim for disability benefits and other monetary awards prayed for by him must be denied. It is evident that Cabatan was repatriated due to the expiration of his contract. Regardless of the cause of his repatriation, he was required to submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by the company-designated physician within three working days upon his return in order to ascertain if he was really suffering from a work-related injury or illness. Cabatan may only be excused from such requirement if he was physically incapacitated to do so. However, such is not the case at bar.\n\nMoreover, in the complementary case of Maunlad Trans Inc. v. Isidro,[54] We held:\nWhile the facts, as found by the CA and the NLRC, point to the existence of a knee injury which respondent suffered in 2009, during the term of his employment contract and while on board the vessel, such knee injury was not the ailment complained of by respondent upon repatriation to the Philippines. x x x[55]\nHere, Cabatan complained of pain in the scrotal\/inguinal area while on board which is why the initial diagnosis by the ship doctor was epididymorchitis. Aside from his bare assertion, there is nothing on record to show that he felt pain or numbness on his lower extremities while on board or that the ship doctor concluded that he contracted spondylolisthesis. It was only on July 2010 or after his repatriation that the said findings were made by a doctor, which is well-beyond the three-day mandatory reporting period.\n\nWhile this Court commiserates with petitioner's plight, non-compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 20 (B), paragraph (3) of the 2000 POEA-SEC renders it difficult to ascertain if his injury or illness was work-related.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Court finds no need to discuss the other issues raised by Cabatan.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED for lack of merit. The January 23, 2015 Decision and July 20, 2015 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 126155 are hereby AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPerlas-Bernabe, (Chairperson), Zalameda, Rosario, and Marquez, JJ., concur.","label":[[18,33,"CASE_NUM"],[35,52,"PROM_DATE"],[55,74,"PERSON"],[92,121,"INS"],[130,143,"PERSON"],[151,179,"INS"],[211,223,"PERSON"],[369,385,"INS"],[387,389,"INS"],[394,415,"CASE_NUM"],[502,537,"INS"],[539,543,"INS"],[548,581,"STA"],[613,632,"PERSON"],[634,641,"PERSON"],[671,700,"INS"],[702,710,"INS"],[740,768,"INS"],[770,789,"INS"],[1042,1049,"PERSON"],[1334,1341,"PERSON"],[1629,1636,"PERSON"],[1995,2002,"PERSON"],[2305,2312,"PERSON"],[2568,2576,"INS"],[2732,2739,"PERSON"],[2915,2921,"PERSON"],[2980,2987,"PERSON"],[3542,3549,"PERSON"],[4312,4319,"PERSON"],[4342,4350,"PERSON"],[4512,4519,"PERSON"],[4556,4564,"INS"],[4598,4607,"PERSON"],[4677,4686,"PERSON"],[4816,4823,"PERSON"],[4843,4864,"PERSON"],[4870,4876,"PERSON"],[5027,5046,"PERSON"],[5466,5473,"PERSON"],[5586,5593,"PERSON"],[6195,6202,"PERSON"],[6569,6576,"PERSON"],[6664,6671,"PERSON"],[6822,6829,"PERSON"],[6965,6972,"PERSON"],[7024,7031,"PERSON"],[7254,7261,"PERSON"],[7320,7324,"INS"],[7451,7464,"INS"],[7466,7468,"INS"],[7513,7515,"INS"],[7534,7541,"PERSON"],[7636,7664,"INS"],[7670,7704,"INS"],[7744,7763,"PERSON"],[8043,8045,"INS"],[8057,8064,"PERSON"],[8224,8231,"PERSON"],[8367,8374,"PERSON"],[8527,8635,"STA"],[8637,8645,"INS"],[8664,8671,"PERSON"],[8699,8734,"INS"],[8791,8794,"INS"],[8814,8821,"PERSON"],[9033,9040,"PERSON"],[9173,9180,"PERSON"],[9315,9322,"PERSON"],[9510,9517,"PERSON"],[9715,9719,"INS"],[9747,9749,"INS"],[9775,9782,"PERSON"],[9843,9850,"PERSON"],[10206,10213,"PERSON"],[10395,10402,"PERSON"],[10472,10476,"INS"],[10529,10545,"INS"],[10559,10566,"PERSON"],[10614,10616,"INS"],[10635,10642,"PERSON"],[10656,10672,"STA"],[11290,11297,"PERSON"],[11626,11633,"PERSON"],[11973,11975,"INS"],[11983,11990,"PERSON"],[12014,12021,"PERSON"],[12198,12200,"INS"],[12332,12339,"PERSON"],[12410,12412,"INS"],[12555,12571,"INS"],[12811,12827,"INS"],[12901,12947,"STA"],[13152,13199,"STA"],[13349,13362,"INS"],[13580,13587,"STA"],[13634,13639,"INS"],[13829,13831,"INS"],[13836,13840,"INS"],[13862,13864,"INS"],[13977,13982,"INS"],[14132,14140,"INS"],[14189,14314,"STA"],[14316,14329,"STA"],[14332,14359,"STA"],[15789,15820,"CASE_NUM"],[16733,16774,"STA"],[16780,16786,"INS"],[16789,16840,"STA"],[16846,16857,"INS"],[16860,16902,"STA"],[16908,16915,"INS"],[16922,16970,"STA"],[16989,16995,"INS"],[17234,17239,"INS"],[17404,17415,"INS"],[17424,17431,"INS"],[17563,17568,"INS"],[17852,17857,"INS"],[18053,18060,"INS"],[18128,18191,"CASE_NUM"],[18201,18206,"INS"],[18518,18570,"STA"],[18751,18786,"STA"],[19156,19163,"PERSON"],[19275,19282,"PERSON"],[19624,19631,"PERSON"],[19797,19825,"CASE_NUM"],[19873,19875,"INS"],[19884,19888,"INS"],[20158,20165,"PERSON"],[20685,20690,"INS"],[20780,20830,"STA"],[20939,20944,"INS"],[20997,21004,"PERSON"],[21159,21175,"INS"],[21179,21200,"CASE_NUM"],[21236,21250,"PERSON"],[21267,21275,"PERSON"],[21277,21284,"PERSON"],[21290,21297,"PERSON"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":156,"text":"FIRST DIVISION\n[ G.R. No. 202029, February 15, 2022 ]\nISABELO CABALHIN, PETITIONER, VS. SPOUSES BONIFACIO LANSUELA AND ISIDRA LANSUELA,* RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\nGESMUNDO, C.J.:\n\nThis is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to set aside the July 20, 2011 Decision[1] and May 8, 2012 Resolution[2] of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City (CA), in CA-G.R. CV No. 01914-MIN, which reversed the November 28, 2007 Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court of Bayugan City, Agusan del Sur, Branch 7 (RTC), in Civil Case No. 669.\n\nAntecedents\n\nThe present controversy involves a parcel of agricultural land (irrigated riceland) situated in Barangay Dacutan, Municipality of Esperanza, Province of Agusan del Sur, with an area of 34,661 square meters. Said property is registered in the name of Isidoro Cabalhin (Isidoro) under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-2133[4] issued on September 3, 1958. Isidoro passed away in 1974.[5]\n\nOn May 31, 2002, Isabelo Cabalhin (petitioner) filed a Complaint[6] for Recovery of Possession with Preliminary and\/or Temporary Restraining Order against the spouses Bonifacio Lansuela (Bonifacio) and Isidra Lansuela (collectively, respondents).\n\nPetitioner alleged that he was in actual, public, continuous, peaceful and adverse possession of the subject land, having inherited the same from his father, Isidoro. During his lifetime, Isidoro was in actual possession and cultivation of the land. In June 1993, while petitioner was visiting relatives in Barobo, Surigao del Sur, Bonifacio, with the aid of some men, by means of force, intimidation, stealth, and strategy, entered the property and, thereafter, planted it with rice. Upon returning from Surigao del Sur in 1997,[7] petitioner immediately demanded that respondents vacate his property, but Bonifacio made threats against his life and safety and that of his family. Bonifacio further claimed to have bought the land from Isidoro, but petitioner could not recall any such conveyance made by his father who, one year before his demise, had given him OCT No. P-2133 and advised him to take good care of the land and administer it. Despite repeated demands to vacate, respondents refused to do so.[8]\n\nIn their Answer with Affirmative Defenses and [Counterclaims],[9] respondents averred that since May 1988, they had been in peaceful possession of the subject land on which they planted rice and other agricultural products. They narrated that the said property was already sold by Isidoro to Enrique Perales (Perales) under a Deed of Sale[10] dated June 20, 1968. The heirs of Perales sold the same to Teodoro Estorion (Estorion) by virtue of a Deed of Extrajudicial Partition with Simultaneous Sale[11] dated August 31, 1973. Under a Deed of Sale[12] dated January 24, 1979, Estorion sold the property to Segros Manaay (Manaay)[13] who, in turn, sold it to Bonifacio under a Deed of Absolute Sale[14] dated May 9, 1988. Moreover, respondents had been paying the real estate taxes due on the land, as evidenced by receipts of tax payments.[15]\n\nIn its April 23, 2003 Order,[16] the trial court granted petitioner's plea for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), enjoining respondents to cease and desist from further planting rice on the disputed land, to vacate the same, and to refrain from disturbing petitioner's possession and occupation of the premises.\n\nOn September 19, 2003, the trial court ordered that the proceeds of the harvest from the subject land be deposited with the court.[17]\n\nAt the pre-trial, the parties agreed to a simultaneous filing of position papers and, thereafter, the case would be submitted for resolution.[18]\n\nThe RTC Ruling\n\nOn November 28, 2007, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of petitioner. It held that the certificate of title in the possession of petitioner serves as an indefeasible and incontrovertible title in favor of the person whose name appears thereon. On the other hand, mere payment of taxes by the respondents is not an evidence of ownership. Significantly, the series of deeds of sale were not registered despite the lapse of 35 years, which is not the usual practice of persons who register real property to prove their ownership by purchase. The Court opined that the failure of the respondents to register the land over a considerable length of time implies that they do not believe themselves to be the owners. Without such registration, ownership is not transferred, thus, petitioner, being the only child of the registered owner, became the exclusive owner of the subject property by operation of law.[19]\n\nThe dispositive portion of the RTC decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring plaintiff ISABELO CABALHIN the lawful owner of the land situated in Dacutan, Esperanza, Agusan del Sur with Original Certificate of Title No. P-2133 under the name of his father Isidoro Cabalhin.\n\nThe Court further declared, ordering herein defendant under the following:\n1. to pay the plaintiff the amount of Php50,000.00 as moral damages[;]\n\n2. to pay the plaintiff the amount of Php20,000.00 as exemplary damages[; and]\n\n3. to pay the plaintiff the amount of Php10,000.00 as necessary litigation expenses.\nLikewise, in order to avoid the acts complained of by herein plaintiff, let a Permanent Injunction be issued against herein defendant.\n\nSO ORDERED.[20]\nRespondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration[21] dated December 28, 2007, which was denied by the trial court on March 5, 2008.[22]\n\nSubsequently, on March 14, 2008, respondents filed a Motion for New Trial[23] based on newly discovered evidence. Meanwhile, the trial court issued a Writ of Permanent Injunction[24] dated March 19, 2008.\n\nOn March 24, 2008, respondents filed an Omnibus Motion to Stay or Lift Permanent Writ of Injunction under Supersedeas Bond.[25] On the same day, they also filed a Notice of Appeal,[26] but this was ordered withdrawn considering that the trial court had earlier directed petitioner to submit his comment on the motion for new trial.[27] Petitioner filed his Opposition to Stay Writ of Permanent Injunction.[28] In its May 5, 2008 Order,[29] the trial court denied respondents' omnibus motion. Respondents' motion for new trial was likewise denied under the trial court's August 15, 2008 Resolution.[30]\n\nOn August 26, 2008, respondents filed a notice of appeal, which was initially denied for having been filed out of time.[31] In their motion for reconsideration, respondents sought to avail of the fresh period to appeal, in accordance with the ruling in Neypes v. Court of Appeals.[32] Accordingly, the notice of appeal was given due course while petitioner's motion for execution was denied.[33]\n\nCA Ruling\n\nIn its Decision,[34] the CA disagreed with the trial court that the failure to register the sale over the subject land has rendered it unenforceable. It ruled that an unrecorded deed of sale is binding between the parties and their privies because actual notice is equivalent to registration. Stressing that registration is not a mode of acquiring ownership, the CA noted that the four deeds of sale in 1968, 1973, 1979, and 1988 were all notarized documents, which carried the evidentiary weight conferred by law upon duly executed instruments.[35]\n\nThe CA further faulted petitioner for failing to discharge his burden of showing that the land possessed by respondents is the very same property that belongs to him, and that the sales embodied in the series of documents presented by the respondents were bogus. Neither was there any allegation in the complaint that the deed of sale in favor of respondents was fake, forged or simulated.[36]\n\nIssue\n\nWhether or not respondents acquired ownership of the land covered by OCT No. P-2133 in the name of Isidoro.\n\nPetitioner's Arguments\n\nPetitioner argues that the purported deeds of sale did not transfer ownership of the subject land to respondents and the alleged vendees before him considering that these were not registered as required by law. Besides, respondents and the previous alleged vendees were not purchasers in good faith, being aware of petitioner's cultivation of the land at the time they supposedly bought it, and that the title was not delivered to anyone of them. Registration being the operative act that binds the land, the unregistered deeds of sale did not make the alleged vendees, nor respondents, the owners of the disputed land.[37]\n\nRespondents' Arguments\n\nRespondents contend that mere possession by petitioner of the certificate of title did not validate his claim of ownership over the subject land already conveyed by his father during his lifetime. Isidoro had, thus, lost ownership of his property which was already excluded from the inheritance of petitioner. Moreover, none of the series of deeds of transfers had been contested by petitioner as to their genuineness and due execution.[38]\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nThe pertinent provisions of the Civil Code are Articles 1496, 1497, 1498, and 1501 which read:\nART. 1496. The ownership of the thing sold is acquired by the vendee from the moment it is delivered to him in any of the ways specified in Articles 1497 to 1501, or in any other manner signifying an agreement that the possession is transferred from the vendor to the vendee.\n\nART. 1497. The thing sold shall be understood as delivered, when it is placed in the control and possession of the vendee.\n\nART. 1498. When the sale is made through a public instrument, the execution thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is the object of the contract, if from the deed the contrary does not appear or cannot clearly be inferred.\n\nx x x x\n\nART. 1501. With respect to incorporeal property, the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 1498 shall govern. In any other case wherein said provisions are not applicable, the placing of the titles of ownership in the possession of the vendee or the use by the vendee of his rights, with the vendor's consent, shall be understood as a delivery.\nUnder the Civil Code, the \"ownership of the thing sold shall be transferred to the vendee upon the actual or constructive delivery thereof.\"[39] Here, the CA recognized respondents' ownership of the subject land pursuant to the deeds of sale which were supposedly conveyances by Isidoro, his buyer Perales, and subsequent vendees. Essentially, Bonifacio's claim is anchored on the conveyance made by Manaay under the Deed of Absolute Sale[40] dated May 9, 1988. The CA was apparently convinced by respondents' position that the execution by Manaay of the said document was sufficient to transfer ownership of the land described therein to them as vendees.\n\nWhile a contract of sale is perfected by mere consent, ownership of the thing sold is acquired only upon its delivery to the buyer. Upon the perfection of the sale, the seller assumes the obligation to transfer ownership and to deliver the thing sold, but the real right of ownership is transferred only \"by tradition\" or delivery thereof to the buyer.[41]\n\nIn Equatorial Realty Development, Inc. v. Mayfair Theater, Inc.,[42] the Court expounded on the concept of delivery, thus:\nDelivery has been described as a composite act, a thing in which both parties must join and the minds of both parties concur. It is an act by which one party parts with the title to and the possession of the property, and the other acquires the right to and the possession of the same. In its natural sense, delivery means something in addition to the delivery of property or title; it means transfer of possession. In the Law on Sales, delivery may be either actual or constructive, but both forms of delivery contemplate \"the absolute giving up of the control and custody of the property on the part of the vendor, and the assumption of the same by the vendee.\"[43] (emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nThe concept of \"delivery\" for the acquisition of the right of ownership was further elucidated in Cebu Winland Development Corporation v. Ong Siao Hua:[44]\nUnder the Civil Code, ownership does not pass by mere stipulation but only by delivery. Manresa explains, \"the delivery of the thing [x x x] signifies that title has passed from the seller to the buyer.\" According to Tolentino, the purpose of delivery is not only for the enjoyment of the thing but also a mode of acquiring dominion and determines the transmission of ownership, the birth of the real right. The delivery under any of the forms provided by Articles 1497 to 1505 of the Civil Code signifies that the transmission of ownership from vendor to vendee has taken place.[45] (emphases supplied)\nIn this case, the CA erred in ruling that ownership of the disputed land was validly transferred to respondents by virtue of the deed of absolute sale executed by Manaay despite the latter not being in possession of either the land or the title. Respondents, as vendees, were not placed in possession and control of the land they bought simply because Manaay did not have such possession. In other words, Manaay could not have effected a constructive delivery of the land to respondents by his execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale dated May 9, 1988.\n\nAs the Court held in Spouses Santiago v. Villamor:[46]\nArticle 1477 of the Civil Code recognizes that the \"ownership of the thing sold shall be transferred to the vendee upon the actual or constructive delivery thereof.\" Related to this article is Article 1497 which provides that \"[t]he thing sold shall be understood as delivered, when it is placed in the control and possession of the vendee.\"\n\nWith respect to incorporeal property, Article 1498 of the Civil Code lays down the general rule: the execution of a public instrument \"shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is the object of the contract, if from the deed the contrary does not appear or cannot clearly be inferred.\" However, the execution of a public instrument gives rise only to a [prima facie] presumption of delivery, which is negated by the failure of the vendee to take actual possession of the land sold. \"[A] person who does not have actual possession of the thing sold cannot transfer constructive possession by the execution and delivery of a public instrument.\"\n\nIn this case, no constructive delivery of the land transpired upon the execution of the deed of sale since it was not the spouses Villamor, Sr. but the respondents who had actual possession of the land. The presumption of constructive delivery is inapplicable and must yield to the reality that the petitioners were not placed in possession and control of the land.[47] (emphases supplied)\nThere being no actual or constructive delivery of the land subject of the sale between Manaay and respondents, the latter did not acquire its ownership. Under the circumstances, when their vendor Manaay had no possession of either the land or the title despite the alleged prior sale transactions over the property, respondents should have been put on guard and should have investigated further why petitioner remains the possessor of the land which was supposedly sold a long time ago. In fact, none of the alleged vendees had taken possession of the land. On this matter, the trial court aptly observed that these purported vendees' unexplained failure and neglect to register the sales in their favor for a considerable period of time is simply contrary to the usual practice of purchasers of real property, which leads to the conclusion that they did not regard themselves as owners. Even Bonifacio failed to register his interest or claim and just proceeded to pay real property taxes without actual delivery of the property to him.\n\nIndeed, it is \"uncharacteristic of a conscientious buyer of real estate not to cause the immediate registration of his deed of sale, as well as the issuance of a new certificate of title in his name.\"[48] More so in this case, where the inaction of the purported vendees lasted for more than 30 years. Petitioner was in possession of both the land and the title all through those years, his possession and cultivation having been disturbed only in June 1993 by respondents who took advantage of his temporary absence.\n\nWhile We sustain the trial court's disposition on the issue of ownership, We find its award of moral and exemplary damages, as well as litigation expenses in favor of petitioner, as bereft of factual and legal support. Hence, the same must be deleted.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The July 20, 2011 Decision and May 8, 2012 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. CV No. 01914-MIN are hereby SET ASIDE. The November 28, 2007 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Bayugan City, Agusan del Sur, Branch 7, in Civil Case No. 669, is hereby REINSTATED with MODIFICATION that the awards of damages and litigation costs are DELETED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCaguioa, Lazaro-Javier, M.

{"id":157,"text":"EN BANC\n[ A.C. No. 8111, February 15, 2022 ]\nADELITA S. VILLAMOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ELY GALLAND A. JUMAO-AS, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\nHERNANDO, J.:\n\nFor the Court's En Banc's consideration is respondent Atty. Ely Galland A. Jumao-as (Jumao-as)' Motion to Reduce Penalty.[1]\nOn December 9, 2020, the Court suspended Atty. Jumao-as from the practice of law for two years for violating Canon 15, Rule 15.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), which provides:\n\nCanon 15 — A lawyer shall observe candor, fairness and loyalty in all his dealings and transactions with his client.\n\nx x x x\n\nRule 15.03 — A lawyer shall not represent conflicting interests except by written consent of all concerned given after a full disclosure of the facts.\n\nAtty. Jumao-as was found to have represented conflicting interests by committing the following acts: he facilitated the incorporation of AEV Villamor Credit, Inc. (AEV), complainant Adelita S. Villamor (Villamor)'s lending company; he persuaded Villamor to borrow money from one Debbie Yu (Yu) to beef up AEV's capital; he left AEV to join 3 E's Debt Equity Grant Co. (3 E's), a lending company owned by Yu; he incited a diaspora of AEV's collectors to join 3 E's; he told AEV's collectors to remit their collections to 3 E's since Villamor owed Yu; and he even sent a demand letter to Villamor, for and in behalf of Yu, demanding that Villamor pay the amount she owed Yu.[2]\n\nAtty. Jumao-as now moves to reduce his penalty, either to a stern warning or a two-month suspension. Humbly admitting to his faults, he prays that this Court consider the reasons quoted hereunder for the mitigation of his administrative punishment:\n\nI was a new lawyer at that time and I fall short of my professional judgment;\n\nLong before the promulgation of this case, I already realized my mistake during the mediation stage of my case x x x. I quickly offered to pay the debts of [Villamor] and I paid her debt [to Yu] x x x I also brokered the reconciliation of complainant with [her] general manager;\n\nEven though the Affidavit of Desistance cannot dismiss the administrative case, I pray that it will be considered as a mitigating factor x x x;\n\nThe bounced checks of the complainant did not reach to court because I personally settled her obligations;\n\nIn the spirit of compassion especially during this time of pandemic where the means of living is difficult to meet, I plead for consideration to shorten my suspension.[3]\nThe Court treats Atty. Jumao-as' Motion to Reduce Penalty as a motion for reconsideration, and grants the same and accordingly reduces the penalty originally meted to Atty. Jumao-as.\n\nHis speedy initiative to make amends and take responsibility of the entire debt of Villamor to Yu in the amount of P650,000.00 is by all means remarkable. He also expended extraordinary efforts to straighten out the corporate scuffles involving him and complainant Villamor and they have resumed their business dealings in good terms. Grave though his transgressions may have been, the sincerity of Atty. Jumao-as' remorse is reflected in his words and actions, which impresses this Court.\n\nThese acts of contrition, however, will not reduce Atty. Jumao-as' administrative liability to the full extent that he desires.\n\nAs he says in his Motion to Reduce Penalty, Atty. Jumao-as may truly have been incapable to spot the beginnings of attorney-client relationships and conflicting interests. However, lawyers such as he can never effectively claim legal ignorance. That he violated his oath as a lawyer is already a permanent dent on his record. His misdeeds towards Villamor must have put the image of the Bar and its members in some degree of embarrassment. He may have been forgiven by his complainant, but the disrepute to the legal profession that he had caused cannot simply be repaired by a mere warning or serving a short-lived suspension from law practice.\n\nThe Court turns to a case factually-similar to the one at hand for guidance.\n\nIn Legaspi v. Atty. Gonzales,[4] complainant therein consulted respondent attorney how to eject an illegal settler who refuses to leave their land. While she never formally engaged respondent's legal services in her personal capacity, complainant still relayed to respondent the details of her quandary. Later, complainant discovered that respondent had become the counsel defending the same illegal settler in an unlawful detainer case filed by complainant's realty development company. The unlawful detainer case ended in an amicable settlement – the illegal settler received money from complainant's company and a parcel of land owned by complainant. Respondent even had a share in the settlement money from the illegal settler. Determining his administrative culpability for advocating conflicting interests, the Court sanctioned the erring lawyer with a year-long suspension from the practice of law.\n\nAll told, the Court finds good reason in jurisprudence and in fact to reconsider its previous administrative sentence of suspension for two years upon Atty. Jumao-as. He shall remain suspended from the practice of law, but for the shorter period of one year.\n\nACCORDINGLY, respondent Atty. Ely Galland A. Jumao-as' Motion to Reduce Penalty is TREATED as a Motion for Reconsideration and the same is GRANTED IN PART. The Court's December 9, 2020 Decision in this case is MODIFIED, in that respondent is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for the reduced period of one year and WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet copies of this Resolution be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be appended to the personal record of Atty. Ely Galland A. Jumao-as as an attorney-at-law; to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines; and to the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts throughout the country for their guidance and information.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nGesmundo, C.J., Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Caguioa, Lazaro-Javier, Inting, Zalameda, M.
