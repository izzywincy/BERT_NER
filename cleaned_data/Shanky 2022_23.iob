the	O

until	O

since	O
it	O

or	O
while	O

with	O
numbness	O

Believing	O
that	O

Lastly,	O
Cabatan's	O

In	O

the	O

reversed	O

dismissed	O
Cabatan's	O
claim	O

It	O
found	O
Cabatan's	O
assertion,	O
that	O

on	O
his	O

What	O

reflected	O

is	O
the	O

Moreover,	O
a	O

Cabatan's	O
failure	O
to	O
report	O
within	O

Cabatan	O

the	O
purpose	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
to	O
enable	I-CASE_NUM
the	I-CASE_NUM
company-designated	I-CASE_NUM
physician	O
to	O
ascertain	O
if	O
the	O
seafarer's	O
injury	O

illness	O
is	O
work-related,	O
viz.:	O
The	O
rationale	O
behind	O
the	O
rule	O
can	O
easily	O
be	O
divined.	O
Within	O
three	O
days	O
from	O
repatriation,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
fairly	O
easier	O
for	O
a	O
physician	O
to	O
determine	O
if	O
the	O
illness	O
was	O
work-related	O
or	O
not.	O
After	O
that	O
period,	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
difficulty	O
in	O
ascertaining	O
the	O
real	O
cause	O
of	O
the	O
illness.	O
To	O
ignore	O
the	O
rule	O
would	O
set	O
a	O
precedent	O
with	O
negative	O
repercussions	O
because	O
it	O
would	O
open	O
the	O
floodgates	O
to	O
a	O
limitless	O
number	O
of	O
seafarers	O
claiming	O
disability	O
benefits.	O
It	O
would	O
certainly	O
be	O
unfair	O
to	O
the	O
employer	O
who	O
would	O
have	O
difficulty	O
determining	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
a	O
claimant's	O
illness	O
considering	O
the	O
passage	O
of	O
time.	O
In	O
such	O
a	O
case,	O
the	O

would	O
have	O
no	O
protection	O
against	O
