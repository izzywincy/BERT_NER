that	O

For	O

accused-appellant	O
vehemently	O
denied	O
the	O

hurled	O
against	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
prosecution	O

raised	O
the	O
defense	O
of	O

While	O
he	O

that	O
he	O
knows	O
AAA	O
as	O
the	O

he	O

that	O
AAA	O
was	O
not	O
living	O
with	O
them	O
and	O
he	O
never	O
visited	O
the	O

Accused-appellant	O
narrated	O
that,	O
in	O
January	O
2013,	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
the	O

that	O
he	O

that	O
AAA	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
their	O

on	O
Sundays	O
before	O
going	O
to	O

To	O
discredit	O
AAA's	O
testimony,	O
accused-appellant	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O
stories	O
were	O
merely	O
fabricated	O
considering	O
that	O
CCC's	O
family	O
never	O
approved	O
of	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
relationship	O
with	O
CCC	O
and	O
that	O

even	O
blamed	O
him	O

the	O
death	O
of	O
their	O
parents.	O
CCC's	O
testimony	O
corroborated	O
accused-appellant's	O
version	O
of	O
facts.	O
According	O
to	O
CCC,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
possible	O
for	O
accused-appellant	O
to	O
have	O
committed	O
the	O
crime	O
because	O
he	O
was	O

the	O

She	O
admitted	O
that	O
her	O

her	O

The	O

no	O
evidence	O
that	O
AAA	O
was	O
moved	O
by	O
any	O
improper	O
motive.	O
It	O
likewise	O
rejected	O
accused-appellant's	O
defense	O
of	O
denial.	O
Hence,	O
this	O
appeal.	O
Accused-appellant	O
argues	O
that	O
the	O
courts	O
a	O
quo	O
gravely	O
erred:	O
(1)	O
in	O
giving	O
credence	O
to	O
private	O
complainant's	O
testimony	O
despite	O
its	O
failure	O
to	O
correspond	O
with	O
documentary	O
evidence	O
presented;	O
and	O
(2)	O
in	O
not	O
considering	O
his	O
defense	O
of	O
denial.	O
He	O
asseverated	O
that	O
AAA	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
detail	O
how	O
he	O
had	O
allegedly	O
sexually	O
abused	O
her.	O
All	O
she	O
did	O
was	O
to	O
describe	O
in	O
general	O
terms	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
inserted	O
his	O
penis	O
into	O
her	O
vagina	O
without	O
narrating	O
the	O
circumstances	O
leading	O
to	O
the	O
incident.	O
He	O
highlights	O
the	O
fact	O
no	O
hymenal	O
laceration	O
or	O
evident	O
injury	O
to	O
AAA's	O
private	O
organ	O
was	O
noted	O
in	O
her	O
medical	O
examination.	O
He	O
stresses	O
that	O
with	O
AAA's	O
testimony	O
discredited	O
and	O
the	O
hatred	O
that	O
their	O
family	O
holds	O
against	O
him,	O
his	O
defense	O
of	O
denial	O
and	O
alibi	O
should	O
be	O
considered.	O
Issue	O
Inevitably,	O
the	O
issue	O
here	O
is	O
whether	O
the	O
lower	O
courts	O
erred	O
in	O
convicting	O
accused-appellant	O
of	O
the	O
crime	O
charged.	O
Ruling	O
of	O
the	O
Court	O
The	O
appeal	O

At	O
the	O
onset,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
noted	O
that	O
the	O
information	O

accused-appellant	O
not	O

with	O
rape,	O
as	O

and	O
"mental	O
retardation."	O
To	O
quote:	O
The	O
term,	O
"deprived	O
of	O
reason,"	O
is	O
associated	O
with	O
insanity	O
or	O
madness.	O
A	O
person	O
deprived	O
of	O
reason	O
has	O
mental	O
abnormalities	O
that	O
affect	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
reasoning	O

and,	O
therefore,	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
capacity	O
to	O
resist,	O
make	O
decisions,	O
and	O
give	O
consent.	O
The	O
term	O
"demented,"	O
refers	O
to	O
a	O
person	O
who	O
suffers	O
from	O
a	O
mental	O
condition	O
called	O
dementia.	O
Dementia	O
refers	O
to	O
the	O
deterioration	O
or	O
loss	O
of	O
mental	O
functions	O
such	O
as	O
memory,	O
learning,	O
speaking,	O
and	O
social	O
condition,	O
which	O
impairs	O
one's	O
independence	O
in	O
everyday	O
activities.	O
We	O
are	O
aware	O
that	O
the	O
terms,	O
"mental	O
retardation"	O
or	O
"intellectual	O
disability,"	O
had	O
been	O
classified	O
under	O
"deprived	O
of	O
reason."	O
The	O
terms,	O
"deprived	O
of	O
reason"	O
and	O
"demented,"	O
however,	O
should	O
be	O
differentiated	O
from	O
the	O
term,	O
"mentally	O
retarded"	O
or	O
"intellectually	O
disabled."	O
An	O
intellectually	O
disabled	O
person	O
is	O
not	O
necessarily	O
deprived	O
of	O
reason	O
or	O
demented.	O
This	O
court	O
had	O
even	O
ruled	O
that	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
credible	O
witnesses.	O
However,	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
maturity	O
is	O
not	O
there	O
despite	O
the	O
physical	O
age.	O
He	O
or	O
she	O
is	O
deficient	O
in	O
general	O
mental	O
abilities	O
and	O
has	O
an	O
impaired	O
conceptual,	O
social,	O
and	O
practical	O
functioning	O
relative	O
to	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
age,	O
gender,	O
and	O
peers.	O
Because	O
of	O
such	O
impairment,	O
he	O
or	O
she	O
does	O
not	O
meet	O
the	O
"socio-cultural	O
standards	O
of	O
personal	O
independence	O
and	O
social	O
responsibility."	O
Thus,	O
a	O
person	O
with	O
a	O
chronological	O
age	O
of	O
7	O
years	O
and	O
a	O
nonnal	O
mental	O
age	O
is	O
as	O
capable	O
of	O
making	O
decisions	O
and	O
giving	O
consent	O
as	O
a	O
person	O
with	O
a	O
chronological	O
age	O
of	O
35	O
and	O
a	O
mental	O
age	O
of	O
7.	O
Both	O
are	O
considered	O
incapable	O
of	O
giving	O
rational	O
consent	O
because	O
both	O
are	O
not	O
yet	O
considered	O
to	O
have	O
reached	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
maturity	O
that	O
gives	O
them	O
the	O
capability	O
to	O
make	O
rational	O
decisions,	O
especially	O
on	O
matters	O
involving	O
sexuality.	O
Decision-making	O
is	O
a	O
function	O
of	O
the	O
mind.	O
Hence,	O
a	O
person's	O
capacity	O
to	O
decide	O
whether	O
to	O
give	O
consent	O
or	O
to	O
express	O
resistance	O
to	O
an	O
adult	O
activity	O
is	O
determined	O

Therefore,	O
in	O
determining	O
whether	O
a	O
person	O
is	O
"twelve	O
(12)	O
years	O
of	O

under	O
Article	B-STA

Here,	O
it	O

that	O
AAA,	O

Further,	O
her	O

the	O

of	O
accused-appellant,	O
whom	O
she	O
called	O

convinces	O
this	O

that	O

AAA.	O
During	O
her	O

examination,	O
the	O

with	O
a	O

AAA	O
pointed	O

the	O

that	O

there	O
where	O

placed	O
his	O

The	O

In	O
an	O

that	O

Suffice	O
it	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
this	O

it	O

This	O

finds	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
compelling	O
reason	O
to	O
disturb	O
the	O

as	O
well	O

the	O

as	O
the	O

came	O
from	O
the	O
straightforward	O
testimony	O
of	O
AAA.	O
In	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
AAA's	O
testimony,	O
accused-appellant's	O
defense	O
of	O
denial	O
and	O

fails.	O
There	O
is	O
no	O
showing	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
impelled	O
by	O
any	O
improper	O
motive.	O
As	O
the	O
Court	O
previously	O
held,	O
"considering	O
the	O

of	O
AAA,	O
[W]e	O
find	O
it	O
highly	O

that	O
she	O
would	O
fabricate	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
likewise	O
unlikely	O
that	O
she	O
was	O

given	O
her	O
limited	O

Due	O
to	O

that	O
she	O
would	O
be	O

to	O

The	O
Court	O
inevitably	O
concludes	O
that,	O
indeed,	O
accused-appellant	O
had	O
carnal	O
knowledge	O
with	O
AAA.	O
The	O
