Petitioner	O
avers	O
that	O
both	O
the	O
CA	B-INS
and	O
the	O
Ombudsman	B-INS
erred	O
in	O
not	O
applying	O
the	O
condonation	O

in	O
his	O
favor	O
considering	O
that	O
his	O

Further,	O
he	O
claimed	O
that	O
his	O
delay	O
in	O
liquidating	O
the	O
cash	O
advances	O
cannot	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
Grave	O
Misconduct	O
as	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
evidence	O
that	O
his	O
omission	O
had	O
been	O
attended	O
by	O
corruption	O
or	O
the	O
willful	O
intent	O
to	O
violate	O
the	O
law	O
or	O
to	O
disregard	O
established	O
rules.	O
In	O
their	O
Comments,	O
respondents	O
maintained	O
that	O
the	O
Ombudsman	B-INS
and	O
the	O
CA	B-INS
correctly	O
ruled	O
that	O
the	O
doctrine	O
of	O
condonation	O
cannot	O
be	O
applied	O
to	O
petitioner	O
because	O
the	O
records	O
are	O
bereft	O
of	O
any	O
proof	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
reelected	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
position	O
of	O
municipal	O
councilor.	O
While	O
the	O
case	O
was	O
pending	O
with	O
the	O
Court,	O
petitioner	O
died	O
of	O
hepatic	O
failure	O
on	O
April	O
14,	O
2019.	O
Thus,	O
in	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
above-mentioned	O
issues,	O
the	O
Court	B-INS
will	O
also	O
resolve	O
whether	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
petitioner	O
warrants	O
the	O
dismissal	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
administrative	O
case	O
against	O
him.	O
The	O
Court¬ís	O
Ruling	O
At	O
the	O
outset,	O
it	O
bears	O
emphasis	O
that	O
petitioner	O
has	O
already	O
admitted	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
liquidate	O
his	O
cash	O
advances	O
within	O
the	O
period	O
set	O
by	O
the	O
COA.	O
He	O
mainly	O
argues	O
that	O
his	O
reelection	O
as	O
a	O
Member	O
of	O
the	O
Sangguniang	B-INS
Bayan	I-INS
of	O
the	O
Municipality	O
of	O
Katipunan,	O

operated	O
as	O
a	O
condonation	O
of	O

previous	O
misconduct	O
pursuant	O
to	O
doctrine	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
Aguinaldo	O
v.	O
Hon.	O
Santos.	O
The	O
question	O
thus	O
arises:	O
Is	O
the	O
condonation	O
doctrine	O
applicable	O
in	O
petitioner's	O
case	O
notwithstanding	O
its	O
abandonment	O
in	O
the	O

no.	O

the	O

applies	O
to	O
those	O
officials	O
who	O
have	O
been	O
re-elected	O
prior	O
to	O

That	O

the	O

he	O

every	O
right	O
to	O

on	O
the	O
old	O
doctrine	O
that	O
his	O
re-election	O
had	O
already	O
served	O
as	O
a	O
condonation	O
of	O
his	O
previous	O
misconduct,	O
thereby	O
cutting	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
remove	O
him	O
from	O
office,	O
and	O
a	O

doctrine	O

him	O

More	O

Similarly,	O
in	O
the	O
2021	O
case	O
of	O
Gaudan	B-PERSON
v.	O
Degamo	B-PERSON
(Degamo),	O
the	O
Court,	O
citing	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
Madreo,	O
ruled	O
in	O
no	O
uncertain	O
terms	O
that	O
"the	O
condonation	O
doctrine	O
is	O
no	O
longer	O
an	O
available	O

on	O

reelection	O
of	O

that	O
he	O
or	O
she	O
had	O
committed	O
during	O
a	O

In	O
this	O
case,	O
petitioner	O
was	O
reelected	O
as	O
a	O
Member	O
of	O
the	O
Sangguniang	B-INS
Bayan	I-INS
of	O
the	O
Municipality	O
of	O
Katipunan,	O
Zamboanga	O
del	O

in	O
the	O
May	O
2016	O
elections.	O
While	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
he	O
ran	O
for	O
a	O
seat	O
as	O
a	O
Provincial	O
Board	O
Member	O
in	O
District	O
II	O
of	O
the	O
Province	O
of	O
Zamboanga	O
del	O

in	O
2013,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
conclusive	O
proof	O
on	O
record	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
successfully	O
elected	O
in	O
the	O
position.	O
On	O
the	O

petitioner's	O

Thus,	O
in	O
line	O
with	O
Madreo	B-PERSON
and	O
Degamo,	O
the	O
Court	O
holds	O
that	O
petitioner's	O
reelection	O
on	O
May	O
9,	O
2016,	O
which	O
took	O
place	O
after	O
the	O
abandonment	O
of	O
the	O
condonation	O
doctrine	O
in	O
Carpio	B-PERSON
Morales	I-PERSON
attained	O
finality,	O
cannot	O
be	O
deemed	O
to	O
operate	O
as	O
a	O
condonation	O
of	O
previous	O
misconduct	O
that	O
he	O
allegedly	O
committed	O
in	O
the	O
years	O
2002,	O
2005	O
to	O
2009	O
and	O
2011.	O
The	O
Court	B-INS
likewise	O
cannot	O
consider	O
petitioner's	O
reelection	O
as	O
a	O
Member	O
of	O
the	O
Sangguniang	B-INS
Bayan	I-INS
of	O
Katipunan,	O
Zamboanga	O
del	O
Norte	O
in	O
the	O
2010	O
elections	O
as	O
a	O
condonation	O
of	O
any	O
misconduct	O
he	O
committed	O
during	O
his	O
two	O
prior	O
terms.	O
To	O
recall,	O
petitioner's	O
original	O
defense	O
in	O
his	O
Counter-Affidavit	O
dated	O
August	O
22,	O
2012	O
was	O
wholly	O
predicated	O
upon	O
the	O
full	O
liquidation	O
of	O
his	O
cash	O
advances	O
as	O
of	O
July	O
27,	O
2012.	O
Moreover,	O
the	O
records	O
show	O
that	O
petitioner	O
had	O
raised	O
condonation	O
as	O
a	O
defense	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
before	O
the	O
CA,	O
which,	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
filing	O
of	O
the	O
Petition	O
for	O
Review	O
in	O
January	O
2016,	O
could	O
have	O
only	O
referred	O
to	O
his	O
reelection	O
in	O
2010.	O
Then,	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
petition,	O
he	O
again	O
cites	O
his	O
reelection	O
as	O
a	O
Member	O
of	O
the	O
Sangguniang	I-INS
Bayan	I-INS
of	O
Katipunan,	O
Zamboanga	O
del	O
Norte,	O
but	O
this	O
time,	O
he	O
offers	O
proof	O
of	O
his	O
reelection	O
on	O
May	O
9,	O
2016	O
per	O
Certification	O
from	O
the	O
Commission	O
on	O
Elections	O
dated	O
February	O
20,	O
2018.	O
On	O
this	O
point,	O
it	O
bears	O
stressing	O
that	O
condonation	O
is	O
an	O
"	O
affirmative	O
fact	O
"	O
that	O
must	O
be	O
raised	O
at	O
the	O
earliest	O
opportunity,	O
i.e.	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
administrative	O
proceedings	O
before	O
the	O
Ombudsman	B-INS
to	O
enable	O
it	O
to	O
fully	O
consider	O
and	O
pass	O
upon	O
the	O
matter.	O
Here,	O
it	O
is	O
indisputable	O
that	O
petitioner	O
had	O
failed	O
to	O
invoke	O
condonation	O
by	O
virtue	O
of	O
his	O
reelection	O
in	O
2010	O
as	O
a	O
defense	O
with	O
the	O
Ombudsman.	O
More	O
than	O
that,	O
he	O
also	O
failed	O
to	O
provide	O
proof	O
of	O
his	O
reelection	O
in	O
2010	O
when	O
he	O
raised	O
the	O
matter	O
of	O
condonation	O
before	O
the	O
CA.	O
Thus,	O
although	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
petitioner's	O
reelection	O
in	O
2010	O
could	O
have	O
possibly	O
operated	O
as	O
a	O
condonation	O
of	O
his	O
purported	O
misconduct	O
in	O
the	O
years	O
2002	O
and	O
2005	O
to	O
2009,	O
his	O
failure	O
to	O
invoke	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
defense	O
before	O
the	O
Ombudsman	B-INS
effectively	O
forecloses	O
any	O
consideration	O
of	O
this	O
factual	O
matter	O
in	O
the	O
proceedings	O
before	O
the	O
Court.	O
The	O
Court	B-INS
shall	O
now	O
resolve	O
the	O
issue	O
regarding	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
petitioner's	O
death	O
during	O
the	O
pendency	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
administrative	O
case	O
against	O
him.	O
In	O

(	O

in	O
view	O
of	O
her	O
death	O
during	O
the	O
pendency	O
of	O
the	O
case.	O
It	O
explained	O
as	O
follows:	O
Hence,	O
when	O
the	O
respondent	O
in	O
a	O
pending	O
administrative	O
case	O
dies,	O
the	O
case	O
must	O
be	O
rendered	O
moot.	O
Proceeding	O
any	O
further	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
violate	O
the	O
respondent's	O
fundamental	O
right	O
to	O
due	O
process.	O
Should	O
it	O
be	O
a	O
guilty	O
verdict,	O
any	O
monetary	O
penalty	O
imposed	O
on	O
the	O
dead	O
respondent's	O
estate	O
only	O
works	O
to	O
the	O
detriment	O
of	O
their	O
heirs.	O
To	O
continue	O
with	O
such	O
cases	O
would	O
not	O
punish	O
the	O
perpetrator,	O
but	O
only	O
subject	O
the	O
grieving	O
family	O
to	O
further	O
suffering	O
by	O
passing	O
on	O
the	O
punishment	O
to	O
them.	O
(Emphasis	O
supplied.)	O
As	O
it	O
currently	O
stands,	O
the	O
respondent	O
in	O
an	O
administrative	O
case	O
must	O
be	O
given	O
the	O
opportunity	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
informed	O
of	O
the	O
judgment	O
against	O
him	O

also	O
to	O

of	O
that	O
judgment	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
fully	O
satisfy	O
the	O
requirements	O
of	O

Because	O
