Even	O
without	O

De	O
Guzman	O
seemingly	O
acted	B-PERSON
as	I-PERSON
a	O
court	O
personnel,	O
which,	O
in	O
my	O
mind,	O
was	O
a	O
means	O
to	O
lure	O
litigants	O
into	O
paying	O
for	O
a	O
consideration	O
in	O
exchange	O
for	O
unwarranted	O

such	O

of	O
their	O

Apart	O
from	O

it	O
was	O
discovered	O
that	O

also	O
took	O
part	B-PERSON
in	I-PERSON
causing	O
the	O
arrest	O
of	O
accused	O
in	O

"who	O
would	O
later	O

after	O

Although	O
further	O
surveillance	O
was	O
recommended	O
to	O
adduce	O
evidence	O
for	O
the	O
above	O
findings,	O
it	O
is	O
my	O
view	O
that	O
De	O
Guzman's	O
transgressions	O
should,	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
course,	O
be	O
dealt	O
with	O
accordingly.	O
Considering	O
that	O
the	O
image	O
of	O
a	O
court	O
is	O
reflected	O
in	O
the	O
official	O
and	O
personal	O
conduct	O
of	O
its	O
employees,	O
she	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
liable	O
for	O
her	O
misrepresentation	O
that	O
not	O
only	O
degrades	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
justice,	O
but	O
also	O
erodes	O
the	O
people's	O
confidence	O
to	O
the	O
courts.[12]	O
The	O
case	O
of	O
De	O
Guzman	O
is	O
not	O
far	O
removed	O
from	O
the	O
instant	O
case	O
wherein	O
Castillo	O
expressly	O
gave	O
representations	O
of	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
influence	O
a	O
judge	O
in	O
a	O
case.	O
While	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
employee	O
of	O
the	O
court,	O
his	O
representation	O
reflected	O
on	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
administering	O
justice.	O
He	O
even	O
used	O
such	O
representation	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
extort	O
money	O
from	O
other	O
people.	O
His	O
act	O
constituted	O
a	O
transgression	O
of	O
his	O
duties,	O
being	O
a	O
mere	O
casual	O
employee	O
of	O
the	O
local	O
government	O
unit.	O
Judicial	O
notice	O
must	O
be	O
taken	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
same	O
building	O
where	O
offices	O

it	O
is	O

to	O
distinguish	O
employees	O
of	O
the	O

from	O

They	O
