At	O
that	O

they	O
had	O
just	O
finished	O

was	O
washing	O

A	O
few	O
moments	O
later	O
Tagle	O
heard	O
a	I-PERSON
knock	O
on	O
the	O

He	O
opened	O
the	O
gate	O
and	O
saw	O
Alegre,	O
who	B-PERSON
was	O
also	O
a	O
security	O

Tagle	O
asked	O
Alegre	O
what	O
he	I-PERSON
was	O
doing	O
there	O
and	O
the	O

replied	O
that	O
he	O
just	O
dropped	O
by	O
to	O
ask	O
how	O
they	O
were	O
and	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
already	O
report	O
for	O
duty.	O
Tagle	O
informed	O
Alegre	O
to	O
report	O
to	O
the	O
operations	O
manager	O
and	O
he	O
subsequently	O
let	O
him	O
in.[10]	O
Alegre	O
then	O
told	O
Tagle	O
that	O
Pascua	O
had	O
been	I-PERSON
saying	O
bad	O
things	O
about	O
him.	O
Tagle	O
cautioned	O
him	O
to	O
keep	O
quiet	O
as	O
Pascua	O
was	O
just	I-PERSON
washing	O
dishes	O
inside.	O
However,	O
Pascua	O
overheard	O
their	O
conversation	O
and	O
asked	O
Alegre	O
about	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
saying.	O
Alegre	O
then	O
started	O
cursing	O
at	O
Pascua	O
and	O
told	I-PERSON
him	O
that	O
he	O
lost	O
his	O
job	O
because	O
of	O
him.	O
A	O
heated	O
exchange	O
ensued	O
between	O
the	O
two.	O
Tagle	O
tried	O
to	I-PERSON
pacify	O
and	O
stop	O
the	O
squabble	O
by	O
leading	O
Alegre	O
out	O
of	I-PERSON
the	O
premises.	O
However,	O
Alegre	O
continued	O
to	O
shout	O
and	O
curse	O
at	O
Pascua,	O
who	O
did	I-PERSON
not	O
back	O
down	O
and	O
also	O
shouted	O
expletives	O
against	O
Alegre.[11]	O
Afterwards,	O
Alegre	O
motioned	O
to	O
his	O
waist	O
area	O
and	O
drew	O
his	O
.38	O
caliber	O
gun.	O
Pascua	O
then	O
told	O
Alegre,	O
"wag	O
mo	I-PERSON
akong	O
daanin	O
sa	O
ganyan,"	O
but	O
Alegre	O
still	O
pulled	O
the	O
trigger	O
and	O
shot	O
him	O
on	O
the	O
neck.[12]	O
When	O
Pascua	O
dropped	O
to	O
the	O
ground,	O
Alegre	O
approached	O
him,	O
almost	O
kneeled	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
him,	O
and	O
proceeded	O
to	O
shoot	O
him	O
on	O
the	O
head.[13]	O
Tagle	O
then	O
wrestled	O
the	O
gun	O
away	O
from	O
Alegre,	O
and	O
he	I-PERSON
and	O
Magpusao	O
closed	B-PERSON
the	O
gate	O
to	O
prevent	O
Alegre	O
from	O
leaving	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
escape	O
through	O
another	O
exit.	O
Nevertheless,	O
Tagle	O
was	O
able	I-PERSON
to	O
chase	O
after	O
him	O
and	O
Alegre	O
was	O
brought	O
to	O
the	O
police	O

thereafter.[14]	O
Pascua	O
instantly	O
died	O
from	O
the	O
shooting	O

that	O

By	O

of	O
his	O

Pascua's	O
family	O
allegedly	O
incurred	O

asked	O

what	O

continued	O

him.	O
Alegre	O
got	O
fed	O
up	I-PERSON

brought	O
out	O

Pascua	O
then	O
told	B-PERSON
him	O
not	O

to	O
such,	O

already	O
lost	O

After	O
a	B-PERSON
judicious	O

that	O

He	O

To	O
appreciate	O
treachery	O
as	O
a	O

circumstance,	O
two	O
conditions	O
must	O
be	O
met:	O
(1)	O
the	O

employed	O
means,	O
methods	O
or	O
forms	O
in	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
criminal	O

the	O

attacked	O
no	O
opportunity	O

to	O
retaliate;	O
and	O
(2)	O

were	O
deliberately	O

The	O

the	O
sudden	O

an	O

on	O
the	O

Jurisprudence	O
dictates	O
that	O

to	O

it	O

pursuant	O
to	O
this	O
Decision.[30]	O
Here,	O
it	O
is	O
conceded	O
that	O
the	O
Information	O
against	O
Alegre	O
is	O
defective	O
insofar	O
as	O
it	O
merely	O
averred	O
the	O
existence	O
of	O
the	O
qualifying	O
offense	O
of	O
treachery	O
without	O
specifying	O
the	O
particular	O
acts	O
and	O
circumstances	O
that	O
would	O
constitute	O
such.	O
However,	O
it	O
is	O
submitted	O
that	O
Alegre	O
is	O
deemed	O
to	O
have	O
waived	O
this	O
defect,	O
considering	O
his	O
failure	O
to	O
avail	O
of	O
the	O
proper	O
procedural	O
remedies.[31]	O
Based	O
on	O
the	O
records,	O
Alegre	O
did	O
not	O
question	O
the	O
supposed	O
insufficiency	O
of	O
the	O
Information	O
filed	O
against	O
him,	O
through	O
either	O
a	O
motion	O
to	O
quash	O
or	O
a	O
motion	O
for	O
bill	O
of	O
particulars.	O
He	O
voluntarily	O
entered	O
his	O
plea	O
during	O
the	O
arraignment	O
and	O
proceeded	O
with	O
the	O
trial.	O
Thus,	O
he	O
is	O
deemed	O
to	O
have	O
waived	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
waivable	O
defects	O
in	O
the	O
Information,	O
including	O
the	O
supposed	O
lack	O
of	O
particularity	O
in	O
the	O
description	O
of	O
the	O
attendant	O
circumstances.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
Alegre	O
is	O
deemed	O
to	O
have	O
understood	O
the	O
acts	O
imputed	O
against	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
Information.[32]	O
Further,	O
as	O
the	O
CA	O
had	O
observed,	O
the	O
issue	O
on	O
the	O
insufficiency	O
of	O
the	O
Information	O
was	O
only	O
raised	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
on	O
appeal.	O
From	O
the	O
foregoing,	O
since	O
Alegre	O
is	O
considered	O
to	O
have	O
waived	O
his	I-PERSON
right	O
to	O
question	O
the	O
defective	O
statement	O
of	O
the	O
aggravating	O
or	O
qualifying	O
circumstance	O
in	O
the	O
Information,	O
treachery	O
may	O
be	O
appreciated	O
against	O
him	O
if	O
proven	O
during	O
trial.[33]	O
On	O
this	O
score,	O
both	O
the	O
RTC	O
and	O
CA	O
found	O
that	O
treachery	O
was	O
present	O
in	B-INS
this	O
case.	O
In	O
its	O
decision,	O
the	O
CA	O
ruled:	O
In	O
this	O
case,	O
Alegre	O
drew	O
a	B-INS
gun.	O
While	O
Pascua	O
told	O
Alegre	O
to	O
not	O
resort	O
to	O
violence	O
("Wag	O
mo	I-PERSON
akong	O
daanin	O
sa	O
ganyan"),	O
Alegre	O
proceeded	O
to	O
shoot	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
neck,	I-PERSON
a	O
vulnerable	O
area.	O
Immediately	O
thereafter,	O
as	O
Pascua	O
slumped	O
to	O
the	O
ground,	O
Alegre	O
approached	O
Pascua	O
and	O
shot	O
him	O
in	I-PERSON
close	O
range	O
on	O
the	I-PERSON
head.	O
There	O
was	O
no	O
way	O
for	O
Pascua,	O
who	O
was	O
unarmed,	O
and	O
had	O
instantaneously	O
fallen,	O
to	O
retaliate.	O
The	O
attack	O
was	O
sudden,	O
and	O
being	O
co-workers	O
in	O
Century	O
Glass,	O
Pascua	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
expected	I-INS
that	O
Alegre	B-PERSON
would	O
actually	O
shoot	O
him,	O
in	O
the	B-PERSON
neck	O
no	O
less.	O
Moreover,	O
the	O
means	O
Alegre	O
employed	O
to	O
execute	O
the	O
crime	O
was	B-PERSON
deliberately	O
and	O
consciously	O
adopted.	O
As	O
pointed	O
out	O
by	O
the	O
OSG,	O
Alegre	O
brought	O
a	O
gun	O
to	O
the	O
company	O
premises	O
when	O
he	O
allegedly	O
only	O
meant	O
to	O
retrieve	O
his	O
things.	O
As	O
soon	O
as	O
Tagle	O
let	O
him	O
in,	O
Alegre	O
started	O
talking	O
about	O
how	O
Pascua	O
had	I-PERSON
said	O
bad	O
things	O
about	O
him	O
that	B-PERSON
cost	O
him	O
his	O
job.	O
Alegre	O
knew	O
exactly	O
what	O
he	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	I-PERSON
when	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
Century	O
Glass	O
Center.[34]	O
The	O
Court	O
disagrees.	O
It	O
has	O
been	O
repeatedly	O
held	O
that	O
"chance	O
encounters,	O
impulse	O
killing	O
or	O
crimes	O
committed	O
at	O
the	O
spur	O
of	O
the	O
moment	O
or	O
that	O
were	O
preceded	O
by	O
heated	O
altercations	O
are	O
generally	O
not	O
attended	O
by	O
treachery	O
for	O
lack	O
of	O
opportunity	O
of	O
the	O
accused	O
to	O
deliberately	O
employ	O
a	O
treacherous	O
mode	O
of	O
attack."[35]	O
Stated	O
otherwise,	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
treachery	O
when	O
the	O
attack	O
is	O
preceded	O
by	O
a	O
heated	O
exchange	O
of	O
words	O
between	O
the	O
accused	O
and	O
the	O
victim,	O
or	O
when	O
the	O
victim	O
is	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
hostility	O
of	O
the	O
assailant	O
towards	O
the	O
former.[36]	O
Here,	O
Alegre	O
had	O
a	O
heated	O
altercation	O
with	O
Pascua	O
before	O
he	O
finally	O
lost	O
his	O
patience	O
and	O
shot	O
him.	O
When	O
Pascua	O
slumped	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
after	O
getting	O
shot	O
in	O
the	O
neck,	O
Alegre	O
moved	O
closer	O
and	O
proceeded	O
to	O
shoot	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
head.	O
Upon	O
realizing	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
just	O
done,	O
he	O
ran	O
and	O
attempted	O
to	O
escape,	O
but	O
was	O
eventually	O
caught	O
by	O
Tagle.	O
Based	O
on	O
the	O
attendant	O
facts,	O
Alegre's	O
acts	O
were	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
a	B-PERSON
sudden	O
impulse	O
or	O
a	O
spur	O
of	O
the	O
moment	O
decision	O
due	O
to	O
his	O
previous	O
heated	O
altercation	O
with	O
the	O
victim,	O
rather	O
than	O
a	O
planned	O
and	O
deliberate	O
action.	O
There	O
is	O
no	O
showing	O
that	O
he	O
consciously	O
employed	O
a	O
particular	O
mode	O
of	O
attack	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
facilitate	O
the	O
killing	O
without	O
any	O
risk	O
to	O
himself.	O
It	O
appears	O
that	O
Alegre	O
shot	O
Pascua	O
because	O
he	O
got	O
fed	O
up	O
and	I-PERSON
was	O
carried	O
away	O
by	O
the	O
anger	O
arising	O
from	O
his	O
confrontation	O
with	O
the	O
deceased.	O
Further,	O
it	O
bears	O
noting	O
that	O
Alegre	O
shot	O
Pascua	O
in	O
their	O
workplace	O
and	O
in	I-PERSON
the	O
presence	O
of	O
Tagle	O
and	O
Magpusao.	O
If	O
Alegre	O
deliberately	O
intended	O
that	I-PERSON
no	O
risk	O
would	O
come	O
to	O
him,	O
he	O
could	O
have	O
chosen	O
another	O
time	O
and	O
place	O
to	O
attack	O
Pascua	O
to	O
ensure	O
success	O
in	O
committing	O
the	B-PERSON
crime.	O
The	O
records	O
are	O
also	O
bereft	O
of	O
any	O
indication	O
that	O
Alegre	O
went	O
to	O
Century	O
Glass	O
Center	O
knowing	O
that	O
Pascua	O
would	O
actually	O
be	O
there.	O
Moreover,	O
it	I-PERSON
is	O
clear	O
that	O
Pascua	O
was	O
aware	O
of	O
Alegre's	O
hostility	O
against	O
him	O
and	O
that	O
there	I-PERSON
was	O
a	O
possibility	O
of	O
an	O
impending	O
atttack.	O
Given	O
the	O
circumstances,	O
the	O
Court	O
finds	O
that	O
treachery	O
was	O
wanting	O
in	O
this	O
case.	O
In	O
the	O
absence	O
thereof,	O
Alegre	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
convicted	O
of	O
Homicide,	O
not	I-PERSON

Under	O

the	O

for	I-STA
the	I-STA

of	I-STA

the	O
