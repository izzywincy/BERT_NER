By	O
grave	O
abuse	O
of	O
discretion,	O
the	O
Court	O
means	O
that	O
which	O
is	O
capricious	O
and	O
whimsical	O
exercise	O
of	O
judgment	O
tantamount	O
to	O
lack	O
of	O

Thus,	O
for	O
the	O
Court's	O
exercise	O
of	O
judicial	O
intervention,	O
the	O
Ombudsman's	O
exercise	O
of	O
power	O
must	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
an	O
arbitrary	O
or	O
despotic	O
manner	O
or	O
that	O
which	O
is	O
so	O
patent	O

gross	O
as	O
to	O

to	O
an	O

A	O
study	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
petition	O
shows	O
that	O
petitioner	O
failed	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
the	O
Ombudsman	O
committed	O
grave	O
abuse	O
of	O
discretion	O
in	O
not	O
finding	O
probable	O
cause	O
against	O
private	O
respondent.	O
In	O
fact,	O
petitioner	O
did	O
not	O
mention	O
of	O
any	O
specific	O
act	O
or	O
omission	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Ombudsman	O
that	O
would	O
show	O
capricious	O
or	O
whimsical	O
exercise	O
of	O
judgment	O
amounting	O
to	O
lack	O
or	O
excess	O
of	O
jurisdiction.	O
As	O
aptly	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
Ombudsman,	O
it	O
is	O
beyond	O
dispute	O
that	O
the	O
questioned	O
travels	O
of	O
private	O
respondent	O
to	O
Initao,	O
Misamis	O
Oriental,	O
on	O
August	O
1	O
and	O
August	O
14,	O
2017,	O
and	O
his	O
appearance	O
before	O
the	O
RTC	O
as	O
Burlado's	O
counsel	O
were	O
all	O
duly	O
approved	O
and	O
made	O
upon	O
the	O
directive	O
of	O
Mayor	O
Regencia.[34]	O
Following	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
presumption	O
of	O
regularity,	O
private	O
respondent's	O
travels	O
were	O
considered	O
official	O
in	O
character	O
and	O
his	O
use	O
of	O
government	O
vehicle	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
attending	O
the	O
preliminary	O
and	O
pre-trial	O
conference	O
for	O
Burlado's	O
libel	O
case	O
was	O
also	O
considered	O
valid	O
and	O
legal[35]	O
unless	O
substantially	O
proved	O
otherwise.	O
Thus,	O
respondent's	O
DTRs	O
cannot	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
falsified[36]	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
that	O
respondent	O
cannot	O
be	O
faulted	O
for	O
following,	O
in	O
good	O
faith,	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
Mayor	O
Regencia.[37]	O
Therefore,	O
petitioner's	O
allegation	O
that	O
private	O
respondent	O
committed	O
the	O
crime	O
of	O
Falsification	O
under	O

In	O

Lastly,	O
gross	O

negligence	O
is	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O

characterized	O
by	O
the	O
want	O

with	O

insofar	O

In	O
this	O
case,	O
however,	O
petitioner	O
failed	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
private	O
respondent	O
caused	O
undue	O

to	O
the	O

or	O
that	O

Section	O
3(e)	O
of	O
RA	O
3019.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	I-RA
it	I-RA
is	I-RA
clear	I-RA
from	O
the	O
findings	O
above	O
that	O
the	O
Ombudsman	O
considered,	O
weighed,	O
and	O
passed	O
upon	O
all	O
the	O
evidence	O
in	O
the	O
case.	O
Notably,	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
capricious,	O
whimsical,	O
or	O
arbitrary	O
in	O
the	O
Ombudsman's	O
exercise	O
of	O
judgment.	O
Thus,	O
any	O
error	O
committed	O
by	O
the	O
Ombudsman	O
in	O
the	O
evaluation	O
of	O
evidence	O
"is	O

an	O

that	O

by	O

To	O
reiterate,	O
the	O
Court	O
stresses	O
that	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	B-INS
a	I-INS

is	O
to	O
secure	O
innocent	O
persons	O
against	O

prosecution,	O
and	O
to	O
protect	O
them	O
from	O
an	O
open	O

public	O
accusation	O
of	O
a	O

from	O
the	O
trouble,	O

of	O

also	O
to	O

from	O
useless	O

trial.[41]	O
To	O
meet	O
this	O
end,	O
it	O

imperative	O
upon	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

to	O
relieve	O
any	O

from	O
the	O
