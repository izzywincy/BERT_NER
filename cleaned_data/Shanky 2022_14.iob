The	O

observed	O
that	O

Nolasco	O
filed	O
two	O

The	O

that	O

Nonetheless,	O
he	O
failed	O

within	O
the	O

and	O
his	O

a	O

(PAO-SACS)	I-INS

and	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
on	O

Nolasco's	O

The	O
CA	O
held	O
that	O
if	O
this	O

the	O
case,	O
how	O
about	O
the	O
May	O
22	O
notice?	O
Counted	O
from	O

Nolasco	O

until	O

to	O

his	O
brief.	O
Yet	O
as	O
of	O
August	O
30,	O
2019,	O
no	O
brief	O
was	O
filed.	O
Proffered	O
as	O
a	O
reason	O
for	O
the	O
non-filing	O
was	O
the	O
volume	O
of	O
pleadings	O
for	O
filing	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
other	O
cases	O
requiring	O
urgent	O
attention.	O
The	O
CA	O
ruled	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
compelling	O
enough	O
to	O
reverse	O
the	O
dismissal	O
of	O
the	O
case.[16]	O
Undaunted,	O
Nolasco	O
filed	O
the	O
present	O
petition.	O
First,	O
he	O
argues	O
that	O
the	O
CA	O
erred	O
in	O
declaring	O
his	O
appeal	O
abandoned	O
despite	O
the	O
excusable	O
circumstances	O
surrounding	O
its	O
belated	O
filing.	O
He	O
states	O
that	O
the	O
work	O
volume	O
in	O
the	O
handling	O
counsel's	O
office	O
is	O
common	O
knowledge.	O
The	O
appellant's	O
brief	O
was	O
finalized	O
on	O
August	O
5,	O
2019	O
and	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
be	O
filed	O
in	O
court	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
served	O
to	O
the	O
opposing	O
party.	O
Yet,	O
due	O
to	O
inadvertence,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
filed	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
pleadings	O
being	O
worked	O
on	O
at	O
the	O
office.	O
Proof	O
of	O
such	O
innocent	O
inadvertence	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
non-filing	O
was	O
only	O
discovered	O
upon	O
receipt	O
of	O
the	O
CA's	O
first	O
assailed	O
Resolution.[17]	O
Nolasco	O
asks	O
the	O
Court	O
to	O
relax	I-PERSON
the	O
strict	O
application	O
of	O
the	O
rules	O
of	O
procedure	O
in	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
its	O
equity	O
jurisdiction.[18]	O
Second,	O
Nolasco	O
asserts	O
that	O
his	O
appeal	O
is	O
meritorious.	O
He	O
alleges	O
that	O
the	O
RTC	O
has	O
no	O
jurisdiction	O
over	O
the	O
case	O
because	O
the	O
complaint	O
did	O
not	O
specify	O
the	O
assessed	O
value	O
of	O
the	O
subject	O
lots.[19]	O
Further,	O
Purence	O
failed	O
to	O
prove	O
its	O
better	O
right	O
to	O
possess	O
the	O
properties	O
since	O
it	O
failed	O
to	O
identify	O
their	O
metes	O
and	O
bounds.	O
There	O
is	O
a	O
possibility	O
that	O
the	O
properties	O
sought	O
to	O
be	O
recovered	O
by	O
Purence	O
are	O
not	O
part	O
of	O
its	O
Certificates	O
of	O
Title.[20]	O
Nolasco	O
maintains	O
that	O
the	O
CA	I-PERSON
gravely	O
misappreciated	O
his	O
plight.	O
He	O
seeks	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
fight	O
for	O
his	O
home	O
based	O
on	O
substantial	O
justice	O
and	O
not	O
on	O
mere	O
technicalities.[21]	O
In	O
its	O
comment,	O
Purence	O
claims	O
that	O
the	O
petition	O
before	O
the	O
Court	O
was	O
filed	O
out	O
of	O
time.	O
It	I-INS
avers	O
that	O
the	O
contumacious	O
failure	O
of	O
Nolasco	O
to	O
abide	O
by	O
the	O
Rules	O
of	I-PERSON
Court	O
justly	O
and	O
legally	O
warranted	O
the	O
order	O
of	O

and	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

Hence,	O
it	O

The	O

that	O

Hence,	O
the	O

After	O

Our	O
