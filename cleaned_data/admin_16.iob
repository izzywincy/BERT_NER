by	O

Considering	O
the	O

that	O

(a)	O
that	O
the	O

InGinete	O

explained	O
the	O
rationale	O
in	O
the	O
relaxation	O
of	O
the	O
rules	O
of	O
procedure	O
in	O

of	O

instances,	O
to	O
wit:	O
Let	O
it	O
be	O
emphasized	O
that	O
the	O
rules	O
of	O

should	O
be	O
viewed	O
as	O
mere	O
tools	O
designed	O
to	O
facilitate	O
the	O
attainment	O
of	O
justice.	O
Their	O
strict	O
and	O
rigid	O
application,	O
which	O
would	O
result	O
in	O
technicalities	O
that	O
tend	O
to	O
frustrate	O
rather	O
than	O
promote	O
substantial	O
justice,	O
must	O
always	O
be	O
eschewed.	O
Even	O
the	O
Rules	O
of	O

reflect	O
this	O
principle.	O
The	O
power	O
to	O
suspend	O
or	O
even	O
disregard	O
rules	O
can	O
be	O
so	O
pervasive	O
and	O
compelling	O
as	O

even	O
that	O
which	O
this	O

be	O
final,	O
as	O
we	O
are	O
now	O
constrained	O
to	O
do	O
in	O

Thus,	O
this	O

is	O
not	O
averse	O
to	O

the	O

Further	O

the	O

Explaining	O
the	O

therefor,	O
this	O
Court	O
held	O
that	O
a	O

would	O
create	O
the	O

situation	O
where	O
"the	O

would	O
both	O
begin	O

be	O
interrupted	O
by	O
the	O

the	O
net	O
effect	O
would	O
be	O
that	O
the	O

would	O
not	O
have	O
effectively	O

having	O

by	O
the	O

of	O

Additionally,	O
this	O
interpretation	O
is	O
consistent	O
with	O
the	O
second	O
paragraph	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
provision	O
which	O
states	O
that	O
"prescription	O

We	O

in	O

(i)	O
The	O

could	O
not	O
have	O
questioned	O
the	O

because	O
it	O
was	O

It	O
is	O
worth	O
noting	O
that	O
although	O
the	O

1974	O
was	O
duly	O
notarized	O
and	O
presumably	O
available	O

the	O

the	O

that	O
the	O

This	O

that	O

for	O
their	O

in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

Hinging	O
from	O
the	O

argument,	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
MOA	O
dated	O
November	O

was	O
executed	O
pursuant	O
to	O
a	O

the	O
more	O
it	O
is	O
highly	O

for	O

the	O

in	O

Hence,	O
contrary	O
to	O

We	O
are	O
not	O

that	O

run	O
in	O
1974	O
when	O
the	O

since	O

conclusion	O
that	O
the	O
Ombudsman	O
exceeded	O
the	O
specified	O
period	O

for	O

investigations.	O
Consequently,	O
the	O
burden	O

to	O
petitioner	O

However,	O
petitioner	O
Republic	O
failed	O
to	O
discharge	O
this	O

Republic	O

the	O

the	O
