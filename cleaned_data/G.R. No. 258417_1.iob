Mr.	O

you	O

that	O
she	O

your	O

A:	O
Actually	O
sir,	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
a	O
label	O
such	O
as	O
girlfriend	O

because	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
she	O

at	O
the	O

we	O

As	O

that	O

The	O

discussed:	O
Furthermore,	O
in	O
support	O
of	O
her	O
testimony	O
[Aileen]	O
sufficiently	O
presented	O
other	O
documentary	O
evidence	O
to	O
bolster	O
her	O
accusations	O
namely:	O
(1)	O
sworn	O
statement	O
she	O
executed	O
at	O
the	O
Orion	O
Municipal	O

(2)	O

(3)	O
various	O
authenticated	O

between	O

(4)	O
several	O

that	O
confirm	O
Borja's	O
cellphone	O
number	O
(calling	O
card,	O
bid	O
forms,	O
RZB	O
company	O
profile).	O
Noticeably	O
also,	O
the	O
incident	O
has	O
left	O
[Aileen]	O
shaken	O
as	O
she	O
applied	O
for	O
a	O
Barangay	O
Protection	O
Order	O
against	O
Borja	O
on	O
24	O
November	O
2016.	O
In	O
an	O
attempt	O
to	O
escape	O
liability,	O
Borja	O
denies	O
inflicting	O
physical	O
harm	O
on	O
[Aileen]	O
and	I-PERSON
insists	O
that	O
the	O
evidence	O
he	O
presented[,]	O
specifically	O
photographs	O
and	O
a	O
PNP	O
Certification	O
of	O
No	O
Fire	O
Arms[,]	O
would	O
reveal	O
that	O
[Aileen]	O
inflicted	O
them	O
on	O
herself.	O
However,	O
Borja's	O
testimony	O
remains	O
self-serving	O
and	O
did	O
nothing	O
to	O
refute	O
[Aileen]'s	O
allegations.	O
The	O
same	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
about	O
[his	O
mother]	O
Cristina's	O
testimony	O
given	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
naturally	O
interested	O
in	O
his	O
acquittal.	O
Denial,	O
as	O
a	O
defense,	O
is	O
inherently	O
weak	O
and	O
is	O
viewed	O
with	O
disfavor	O
by	O
the	O
courts	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
facility	O
with	O
which	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
concocted.	O
The	O
same	O
cannot	O
prevail	O
over	O
the	O
positive	O
identification	O
of	O
the	O
accused	O
by	O
the	O
prosecution	O
witness.	O
In	O
this	O
case,	O
Borja	O
could	O
only	O
offer	O
constant	O
denial	O
of	O
the	O
crime	O
charged	O
and	O
feeble	O
attempts	O
to	O
evade	O
culpability.	O
Assuming	O
arguendo	O
that	O
indeed	O
[Aileen]	O
bas	O
the	O
propensity	O
to	O
inflict	O
self-harm,	O
this	B-PERSON
does	O
not	O
preclude	O
the	O
possibility	O
that	O
the	O
injuries	O
she	O
sustained	O
as	O
reflected	O
in	O
the	O
Medico-Legal	O
report	O
were	O
inflicted	O
by	O
Borja.	O
Similarly,	O
the	O
PNP	O
Certificate	O
of	O
No	O
Fire	O
Arms	B-PERSON
is,	O
at	O
most,	O
a	O
proof	O
that	O
Borja	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
registered	O
firearms	O
holder	O
but	O
this	O
does	I-PERSON
not	O
also	O
forego	O
the	O
probability	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
possessing	O
such	O
weapon	O
illegally.	O
Meanwhile,	O
[Aileen]	O
has	O
consistently	O
positively	O
identified	O
Borja	O
as	I-PERSON
her	O
assailant.	O
More	O
importantly,	O
per	O
text	O
messages	O
she	O
offered	O
as	O
exhibits,	O
it	O
was	O
revealed	O
that	O
Borja	O
himself	O
admitted,	O
albeit	O
sarcastically	O
downplaying	O
the	O
act,	O
to	O
inflicting	O
physical	O
harm	O
on	O
[Aileen].	O
As	O
against	O
Borja's	O
bare	O
denial	O
of	O
the	O
crime	O
charged	O
versus	O
[Aileen]'s	O
testimony	O
coupled	O
with	O
ample	O
pieces	O
of	O
documentary	O
evidence,	O
We	O
find	O
[Aileen]'s	O
version	O
of	O
facts	O
worthy	O
of	O
credence.	O
Thus,	O
absent	O
any	O
proof	O
that	O
the	O

has	O
overlooked	O
a	O

which	O
[Aileen]	O

We	O
uphold	O
the	O

The	O
