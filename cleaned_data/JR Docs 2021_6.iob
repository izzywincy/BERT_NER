Petitioner's	O
Arguments	O
Petitioner	O
argues	O
that	O
while	O
she	O
mistakenly	O
filed	O
a	O
Manifestation	O
with	O
Motion	O
to	O
Dismiss	O
Appeal,	O
she	O
was	O
asking	O
for	O
the	O

of	O

not	O
her	O

In	O

the	O
allegations	O
therein	O
control	O
and	O
should	O
prevail	O
over	O
the	O
caption	O
or	O
title.	O
Petitioner	O
claims	O
that	O
the	O
CA	B-INS
erred	O
in	O
declaring	O
the	O
dismissal	O
order	O
as	O
final	O
and	O
executory	O
and	O
beyond	O

Petitioner	O
timely	O

a	O
motion	O
for	O
reconsideration	O
to	O
assail	O
the	O
Resolution	O
dated	O
September	O
10,	O
2018.	O
With	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
Milagros,	O
Julito	B-PERSON
became	O
the	O
owner	O
of	O
1/3	O
of	O
the	O
subject	O
property.	O
It	O
is	O
a	O
portion	O
of	O
this	O
property	O
where	O
she	O
earns	O
by	O
selling	O
meat	O
products	O
which	O
she	O
uses	O
to	O
defray	O
the	O
monthly	O
expenses	O
of	O
around	O
P80,000.	O
for	O
the	O
subsistence	O
of	O
her	O
husband.	O
To	O
eject	O
petitioner	O
is	O
in	O
effect	O
to	O
deprive	O
her	O
husband	O
of	O
his	O
right	O
to	O
continue	O
utilizing	O
the	O
place	O
for	O
business,	O
whose	O
income	O
assures	O
him	O
of	O
daily	O
survival	O
and	O
violates	O
his	O
right	O
as	O
an	O
owner.	O
Respondents'	O
Comment	O
Respondents	O
aver	O
that	O
the	O
CA	B-INS
did	O
not	O
err	O
when	O
it	O
dismissed	O
the	O
appeal.	O
Petitioner	O
is	O
the	O
party	O
being	O
ejected	O
and	O
not	O
her	O
husband.	O
Petitioner	O
is	O
allowed	O
to	O
engage	O
in	O
business	O
and	O
can	O
enter	O
into	O
contract	O
independent	O
of	O
her	O
husband.	O
According	O
to	O
respondents,	O
petitioner's	O
contention	O
that	O
she	O
cannot	O
be	O
ejected	O
since	O
her	O
husband	O
is	O
a	O
co-owner	O
of	O
the	O
property	O
and	O
the	O
absurdity	O
that	O
a	O
husband	O
will	O
eject	O
his	O
wife	O
from	O
the	O
premises	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
considered.	O
Respondents'	O
cause	O
of	O
action	O
to	O
file	O
the	O
ejectment	O
case	O
already	O
existed	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
the	O
demand	O
to	O
pay	O
and	O
vacate	O
the	O
premises	O
was	O
made	O
on	O
May	O
20,	O
2014.	O
Further,	O
respondents	O
contend	O
that	O
petitioner's	O
Manifestation	O
with	O
Motion	O
to	O
Dismiss	O
Appeal	O
is	O
a	O
clear	O
abandonment	O
and	O
waiver	O
of	O
her	O
right	O
to	O
appeal	O
to	O
the	O
CA	B-INS
the	O
decision	O
of	O
the	O
RTC.	O
Contrary	O
to	O
petitioner's	O
assertion,	O
respondents	O
argue	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
co-ownership	O
between	O
respondents	O
and	O
petitioner's	O
husband	O
since	O
Milagros	B-PERSON
had	O
already	O
sold	O
the	O
property	O
to	O
her	O
son,	O
respondent	O
John	B-PERSON
A.	I-PERSON
Viray,	O
as	O
evidenced	O
by	O
a	O
Deed	O
of	O
Absolute	O
Sale	O
dated	O
November	O
16,	O
2015.	O
Said	O
sale	O
is	O
a	O
supervening	O
event	O
that	O
erased	O
her	O
husband's	O
claim	O
of	O
co-ownership.	O
Finally,	O
when	O
petitioner	O
agreed	O
to	O
leased	O
the	O
property	O
in	O
January	O
1993,	O
she	O
recognized	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
Milagros	B-PERSON
as	O
lessor	O
and	O
owner	O
thereof.	O
Ruling	O
of	O
the	O
Court	O
The	O
petition	O
is	O
meritorious.	O
After	O
a	O
judicious	O
review	O
of	O
the	O
records	O
of	O
the	O
case,	O
the	O
Court	O
finds	O
that	O
the	O
CA	B-INS
erred	O
in	O
ruling	O
that	O
the	O
filing	O
of	O
the	O
Manifestation	O
with	O
Motion	O
to	O
Dismiss	O
Appeal	O
has	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
withdrawal	O
of	O
petitioner's	O
petition	O
for	O
review	O
under	O
Rule	O
42.	O
When	O
the	O
CA	B-INS
considered	O
the	O
case	O
closed	O
and	O
terminated	O
and	O
directed	O
the	O
Division	O
Clerk	O
of	O
Court	O
to	O
issue	O
an	O
Entry	O
of	O
Judgment,	O
the	O
CA	B-INS
in	O
effect	O
affirmed	O
the	O
ruling	O
of	O
the	O
METC	B-INS
and	O
the	O
RTC	B-INS
ordering	O
petitioner	O
and	O
all	O
persons	O
claiming	O
rights	O
under	O
her	O
to	O
vacate	O
the	O
stall	O
and	O
restore	O
its	O
possession	O
to	O
Milagros.	O
This	O
is	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O
the	O
final	O
and	O
executory	O
judgment	O
against	O
petitioner,	O
which	O
is	O
clearly	O
erroneous.	O
The	O
CA	B-INS
misunderstood	O
the	O
import	O
of	O
the	O
Manifestation	O
with	O
Motion	O
to	O
Dismiss	O
Appeal	O
filed	O
by	O
petitioner.	O
A	O
simple	O
reading	O
thereof	O
simply	O
means	O
that	O
petitioner	O
seeks	O
to	O
dismiss	O
the	O
ejectment	O
case,	O
and	O
not	O
her	O
petition	O
for	O
review	O
with	O
the	O
CA.	O
What	O
matters	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
caption	O
of	O
the	O
pleading	O
but	O
the	O
allegations	O
contained	O
therein.	O
It	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
in	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
Milagros,	O
her	O
husband	O
as	O
son	O
of	O
the	O
registered	O
owner	O
Milagros,	O
becomes	O
a	O
co-owner	O
of	O
the	O
property,	O
and	O
cannot	O
be	O
ejected	O
from	O
a	O
portion	O
of	O
the	O
undivided	O
property.	O
For	O
an	O
unlawful	O
detainer	O
action	O
to	O
prosper,	O
the	O
plaintiff	O
must	O
allege	O
and	O
establish	O
the	O
following	O
key	O
jurisdictional	O
facts:	O
(I)	O
initially,	O
possession	O
of	O
property	O
by	O
the	O
defendant	O
was	O
by	O
contract	O
with,	O
or	O
by	O
tolerance	O
of,	O
the	O
plaintiff;	O
(2)	O
eventually,	O
such	O
possession	O
became	O
illegal	O
upon	O
notice	O
by	O
the	O
plaintiff	O
to	O
the	O
defendant	O
of	O
the	O
termination	O
of	O
the	O
latter's	O
right	O
of	O
possession;	O
(3)	O
thereafter,	O
the	O
defendant	O
remained	O
in	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
property	O
and	O
deprived	O
the	O
plaintiff	O
of	O
the	O
enjoyment	O
thereof;	O
and	O
(4)	O
within	O
one	O
year	O
from	O
the	O
last	O
demand	O
on	O
the	O
defendant	O
to	O
vacate	O
the	O
property,	O
the	O
plaintiff	O
instituted	O
the	O
complaint	O
for	O
ejectment.	O
Under	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
this	O
case,	O
it	O
is	O
reasonable	O
for	O
the	O
Court	O
to	O
consider	O
that	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
neither	O
an	O
oral	O
lease	O
between	O
Milagros	B-PERSON
and	O
petitioner,	O
nor	O
was	O
there	O
tolerance	O
from	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
petitioner's	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
property	O
in	O
1993.	O
The	O
court	O
is	O
more	O
inclined	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
amount	O
given	O
by	O
petitioner	O
to	O
Milagros	B-PERSON
was	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
a	O
financial	O
assistance	O

to	O

and	O
not	O

complaint	O
for	O
unlawful	O

in	O
July	O
2014.	O
Milagros	B-PERSON
alleged	O
in	O
the	O
complaint	O
that	O
the	O
tolerance	O
started	O
in	O
1993	O
when	O
she	O
verbally	O
leased	O
the	O
stall	O
to	O
petitioner.	O
In	O
1993,	O
the	O
subject	O

the	O
property	O
in	O
1993	O
was	O
by	O
tolerance	O

possession	O

In	O
an	O
unlawful	O
detainer	O
case,	O
the	O
key	O
jurisdictional	O
fact	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
proved	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
tolerance	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
present	O
right	O
from	O
the	O
very	O
start	O
of	O
possession,	O
and	O
We	O
may	O
hasten	O
to	O
add,	O
that	O
such	O
nature	O
of	O
possession	O
by	O
tolerance	O
shall	O
continue	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
filing	O
of	O
the	O

complaint.	O
When	O
Milagros	B-PERSON
filed	O
a	O
complaint	O
for	O
unlawful	O
detainer	O
in	O

she	O
failed	O

all	O

the	O
