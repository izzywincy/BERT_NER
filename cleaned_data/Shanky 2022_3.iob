working	O
as	O

the	O
Philippine	O
Embassy	I-INS
and	I-INS
where	O

was	I-PERSON
studying	O
for	O

After	O
joining	O
several	O
group	O
dates,	O
the	O
two	O
broke	O
up	O
with	O
their	O

and	O
became	O

They	O
lived	O
together	O
in	O
Madrid	O
from	O
1996	O
to	O
1997;	O
at	O
that	O
time,	O
Jose	O
had	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
Philippines	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
work.	O
On	O
January	O
14,	O
1998,	O
while	O
Elizabeth	O
was	I-PERSON
on	O
vacation	O
in	O
the	O
Philippines,	O
the	O
two	O
got	O
married	O
in	O

Two	O
days	O
later,	O

flew	O
back	O
to	O
Madrid,	O
while	O
Jose	O
was	I-PERSON
left	O
behind	O
because	O
of	O
his	O
job.[5]	O
Jose	O
visited	O
Elizabeth	O
in	I-PERSON
Spain	O
from	O
December	O
1998	O
until	O
January	O
1999.	O
Soon,	O
Elizabeth	O
became	O
pregnant	O
and	O
gave	O
birth	O
to	O
their	O
first	O
child,	O
Joaquin	O
Carlos	I-PERSON
A.	I-PERSON
Alberto	I-PERSON
(Joaquin	O
Carlos),	I-PERSON
on	I-PERSON
September	O
18,	O
1999.[6]	O
According	O
to	O
Elizabeth,	O
even	I-PERSON
before	O
they	O
got	O
married,	O
she	O
noticed	O
that	O
Jose	O
was	O
irresponsibleâ€”he	O
would	O
get	O
drunk	O
until	O
he	O
passes	O
out;	O
he	O
would	O
also	O
smoke	O
cigarettes	O
and	O
marijuana;	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
bouts	O
of	O
depression.	O
However,	O
she	O
overlooked	O
all	O
these	O
shortcomings	O
and	O
hoped	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
change	O
him	O
for	O
the	O
better.[7]	O
While	O
Elizabeth	O
was	I-PERSON
working	O
in	O
Madrid,	O
Jose	O
had	O
an	I-PERSON
affair	O
with	O
a	O
certain	O
Joyce	O
David	O
(Joyce).	O
Elizabeth	O
saw	I-PERSON
in	I-PERSON
Jose's	O
cellular	O
phone	O
romantic	O
and	O
erotic	O
messages	O
from	O
Joyce.[8]	O
Joyce	O
also	O
sent	O
letters	O
and	O
a	O
picture	O
of	O
her	O
and	O
Jose	O
to	O
Elizabeth;	O
she	I-PERSON
told	O
the	O
latter	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
useless	O
for	O
her	O
to	O
stop	O
the	O
affair	O
because	O
Jose	O
"craves"	O
for	O
her	O
(Joyce)	O
in	O
bed.	O
Jose	O
confirmed	O
his	O
relationship	O
with	O
Joyce	O
and	O
promised	O
to	O
stop	O
it.	O
But	O
after	O
that,	O
Jose	O
would	O
seldom	O
come	O
home.	O
Elizabeth	O
also	I-PERSON
learned	O
that	O
Jose	O
and	O
Joyce	O
had	O
sexual	O
intercourse	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
Joaquin	O
Carlos.[9]	I-PERSON
After	O
Jose	O
confessed	O
and	O
promised	O
to	O
end	O
the	O
affair,[10]	O
Elizabeth	O
gave	I-PERSON
him	O
another	O
chance.	O
In	O
2002,	O
they	O
planned	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Canada	O
where	O
she	O
was	O
assigned.	O
But	O
Jose	O
was	O
unhappy,	O
and	O
his	O
behavior	O
made	O
it	O
difficult	O
for	O
Elizabeth	O
to	I-PERSON
recover	O
from	O
the	O
hurts	O
of	O
the	O
past.	O
After	O
giving	O
birth	O
to	O
their	O
second	O
child,	O
Ma.	O
Teresa	O
A.	I-PERSON
Alberto,	I-PERSON
in	I-PERSON
April	O
2003,	O
Elizabeth	O
no	I-PERSON
longer	O
slept	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
room	O
with	O
Jose	O
and	O
had	I-PERSON
no	O
sexual	O
contact	O
with	O
him	O
since	O
then.[11]	O
The	O
two	O
eventually	O
parted	O
ways	O
in	O
2008;	O
Jose	O
stopped	O
communicating	O
and	O
giving	O
support	O
to	O
Elizabeth	O
and	I-PERSON
their	O
children.[12]	O
Elizabeth	O
asserted	I-PERSON
that	O
during	O
their	O
cohabitation	O
as	O
husband	O
and	O
wife,	O
Jose	O
fell	O
short	O
of	O
his	O
financial	O
obligations	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
often	O
without	O
a	O
job.	O
He	O
would	O
get	O
depressed	O
and	O
sleep	O
for	O
long	O
hours.	O
He	O
would	O
rely	O
on	O
her	O
to	O
make	O
decisions	O
in	O
the	O
household.	O
He	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
for	O
the	O
children	O
even	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
sick,	O
and	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
attend	O
their	O
school	O
activities.	O
He	O
even	O
physically	O
hurt	O
their	O
eldest	O
child	O
to	O
get	O
him	O
to	O
obey	O
his	O
orders.[13]	O
Clinical	O
psychologist	O
Dr.	O
Rowena	O
R.	I-PERSON
Belen	I-PERSON
(Dr.	I-PERSON
Belen)	O
identified	O
the	O
report[14]	O
she	O
prepared	O
based	O
on	O
tests	O
conducted	O
on	O
Elizabeth,	O
as	I-PERSON
well	I-PERSON
as	O
on	O
interviews	O
with	O
Elizabeth	O
and	B-PERSON
the	I-PERSON
children.	O
She	O
also	O
tried	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
touch	O
with	O
Jose,	O
but	O
was	B-PERSON
unable	O
to	O
do	O
so.[15]	O
Based	O
on	O
her	O
evaluation,	O
Dr.	O
Belen	O
concluded	O
that	O
Jose	O
has	O
a	O
Narcissistic	O
Personality	O
Disorder.	O
This	O
is	O
shown	O
by	O
the	O
following:	O
(1)	O
his	O
failure	O
to	O
stay	O
long	O
in	O
any	O
job	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
suit	O
his	O
standards;	O
(2)	O
his	O
defiance	O
to	O
conventional/moral	O
rules,	O
as	O
he	O
engaged	O
in	O
a	O
sexual	O
affair	O
with	O
another	O
woman	O
and	O
disregarded	O
his	O
vow	O
to	O
his	O
wife,	O
just	O
to	O
satisfy	O
his	O
desires;	O
(3)	O
his	O
careless	O
disregard	O
for	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
others	O
especially	O
those	O
of	O
his	O
wife	O
and	O
children	O
for	O
his	O
constant	O
support;	O
(4)	O
his	O
shameless	O
neglect	O
of	O
his	O
wife	O
and	O
children;	O
(5)	O
his	O
interpersonal	O
exploitative	O
tendencies	O
as	O
he	O
used	O
other	O
people,	O
especially	O
his	O
wife	O
to	O
enhance	O
himself	O
and	O
satisfy	O
his	O
needs;	O
(6)	O
his	O
grandiose	O
sense	O
of	O
self-importance	O
and	O
strong	O
sense	O
of	O
entitlement,	O
as	O
he	O
expects	O
to	O
be	O
recognized	O
and	O
be	O
given	O
special	O
favors	O
without	O
assuming	O
reciprocal	O
responsibilities;	O
and	O
(7)	O
his	O
constant	O
need	O
for	O
attention.[16]	O
Dr.	O
Belen	O
declared	O
that	O
the	O
root	O
cause	O
of	O
Jose's	O
personality	O
can	O
be	O
traced	O
to	O
his	O
childhood.	O
He	O
came	O
from	O
a	O
wealthy	O
and	O
politically	O
influential	O
family;	O
thus,	O
he	O
was	O
pampered	O
with	O
material	O
things.	O
But	O
he	O
was	O
deprived	O
of	O
attention	O
and	O
affection	O
as	O
his	O
parents	O
were	O
too	O
busy.	O
Such	O
personality,	O
which	O
was	O
already	O
in	O
existence	O
since	O
childhood,	O
is	O
grave	O
as	O
it	O
impairs	O
him	O
to	O
handle	O
the	O
demands	O
of	O
interpersonal	O
adjustment.	O
He	O
sees	O
nothing	O
wrong	O
with	O
himself,	O
and	O
thus,	O
he	O
remains	O
impervious	O
to	O
change	O
and	O
improvement.[17]	O

of	O
the	O
Family	O

of	O
the	I-STA

recognizes	O
psychological	O

Tan-Andal	O

Andal[33]	O
(Tan-Andal),	O
the	O
Court	I-CASE_NUM
has	I-CASE_NUM
clarified	O
that	O
psychological	O
incapacity	O
is	O
neither	O
a	O
mental	O
incapacity	O
nor	O
a	O
personality	O
disorder	O
that	O
must	O
be	O
proven	O
through	O
expert	O
opinion.	O
In	O
addition,	O
the	O
Court	O
declared:	O
There	O
must	O
be	O
proof,	O
however,	O
of	O
the	O
durable	O
or	O
enduring	O
aspects	O
of	O
a	O
person's	O
personality,	O
called	O
"personality	O
structure,"	O
which	O
manifests	O
itself	O
through	O
clear	O
acts	O
of	O
dysfunctionality	O
that	O
undermines	O
the	O
family.	O
The	O
spouse's	O
personality	O
structure	O
must	O
make	O
it	O
impossible	O
for	O
him	O
or	O
her	O
to	O
understand	O
and,	O
more	O
important,	O
to	O
comply	O
with	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
essential	O
marital	O
obligations.[34]	O
It	O
is	O
the	O
plaintiff-spouse	O
who	O
has	O
the	O
burden	O
to	O
prove	O
by	O
clear	O
and	O
convincing	O
evidence	O
the	O
existence	O
of	O
psychological	O
incapacity.	O
"Clear	O
and	O

is	O
more	O
than	O
"preponderant"	O
but	O
less	O
than	O
"proof	O
beyond	O
reasonable	O
doubt,"	O
following	O
the	O
presumption	O
of	O
validity	O
of	O
marriages.[35]	O
Also,	O
the	O
alleged	O
psychological	O
incapacity	O
must	O
be	O
shown	O
to	O
be	O
grave,	O
incurable,	O
and	O
juridically	O
antecedent.[36]	O
"Gravity"	O
is	O
understood	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
incapacity	O
caused	O
by	O
a	O
genuinely	O
serious	O
psychic	O
cause.	O
It	O
need	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
serious	O
or	O
dangerous	O
illness.	O
However,	O
"mild	O
characterological	O
peculiarities,	O
mood	O
changes,	O
occasional	O
emotional	O
outbursts"	O
are	O
excluded.	O
It	O
is	O
not	O
mere	O
"refusal,	O
neglect,	O
or	O
difficulty,	O
much	O
less	O
ill	O
will."[37]	O
"Incurability"	O
meanwhile	O
should	O
be	O
viewed	O
in	O
its	O
legal,	O
and	O
not	O
medical,	O
sense.	O
Since	O
psychological	O
incapacity	O
is	O
not	O
medically	O
an	O
illness,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
something	O
to	O
be	O
cured.	O
The	O
incapacity	O
however	O
must	O
be	O
so	O
enduring	O
and	O
persistent	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
a	O
specific	O
partner,	O
and	O
contemplates	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
the	O
couple's	O
respective	O
personality	O
structures	O
are	O
so	O
incompatible	O
and	O
antagonistic	O
that	O
the	O
only	O
result	O
in	O
the	O
union	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
inevitable	O
and	O
irreparable	O
breakdown	O
of	O
the	O
marriage.	O
There	O
must	O
be	O
an	O
undeniable	O
pattern	O
of	O
such	O
persisting	O
failure	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
present,	O
loving,	O
faithful,	O
respectful	O
and	O
supportive	O
spouse,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
indeed	O
a	O
psychological	O
anomaly	O
or	O
incongruity	O
in	O
the	O
spouse	O
relative	O
to	O
the	O
other.[38]	O
Finally,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
"juridically	O
antecedent."	O
This	O
means	O
that	O
the	O
psychological	O
incapacity	O
must	O
be	O
existing	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
celebration	O
of	O
the	O
marriage,	O
even	O
if	O
such	O
incapacity	O
becomes	O
manifest	O
only	O
after	O
its	O
solemnization.	O
It	O
is	O
an	O
accepted	O
principle	O
in	O
psychology	O
that	O
a	O
person's	O
behavior	O
is	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
interaction	O
of	O
certain	O
genetic	O
predispositions	O
and	O
by	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
environment.	O
Proof	O
of	O
juridically	O
antecedent	O
psychological	O
incapacity	O
may	O
therefore	O
consist	O
of	O
testimonies	O
describing	O
the	O
environment	O
where	O
the	O
supposedly	O
incapacitated	O
spouse	O
lived	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
led	O
to	O
a	O
particular	O
behavior.[39]	O
Cases	O
have	O
also	O
given	O
weight	O
to	O
trial	O
court's	O
findings	O
and	O
evaluation	O
on	O
the	O
existence	O
or	O
non-existence	O
of	O
a	O

the	O

in	I-PERSON
Tan-Andal,	O
proof	O

Ordinary	O
witnesses	O
who	O

the	O

may	O
testify	O
on	O
behavior	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
consistently	O
observed	O
from	O
the	O
supposedly	O
incapacitated	O
spouse.	O
From	O
these,	O
the	O
judge	O
will	O
decide	O
if	O
the	O
behaviors	O
are	O
indicative	O
of	O
a	O
true	O
and	O
serious	O
incapacity	O
to	O
assume	O
the	O
essential	O
marital	O
obligations.[43]	O
In	O
this	O
way,	O
the	O
intent	O
to	O
limit	O
the	O
incapacity	O
to	O
"psychic	O

is	O
fulfilled	O
and	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
no	O
need	O
to	O

a	O

a	O
mental	O
disorder	O
just	O
to	O
obtain	O
a	O
decree	O

a	O

that	O

required.[45]	O
When	O

that	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O

information	O

Lack	O
of	O

does	O
not	O

Jose's	O
psychological	O

This	O

This	O
