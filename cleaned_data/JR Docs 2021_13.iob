the	O

Furthermore,	O

did	O
not	O
show	O
their	O
actual	O
possession	O
over	O
the	O

which	O
thus	O
belies	O
their	O

The	O

particularly	O
as	O

the	O
location,	O

description	O
of	O
the	O

Lastly,	O
the	O

the	O

of	O

that	O

In	O

raised	O
purely	O

which	O

by	O
the	O

Even	O
brushing	O
aside	O
technical	O
infirmities,	O
the	O

also	O
aver	O
that	O

for	O
they	O

stress	O
that	O

Consequence	O
of	O
a	O

of	O

The	O

This	O

was	O
duly	O
admitted	O
by	O
the	O

in	O
their	O

However,	O
they	O
argue	O
that	O
such	O
was	O
not	O
fatal	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
jurisdictional	O
as	O
to	O
affect	O
their	O

We	O

Altres	O

Empleo	O
laid	O

the	O

guidelines	O
with	O

to	O
noncompliance	O
with	O
the	O
requirements	O
on	O
or	O
submission	O
of	O
a	O
defective	O
verification	O
and	O
certification	O
against	O

shopping:	O
1)	O
A	O
distinction	O
must	O
be	O
made	O
between	O
non-compliance	O
with	O
the	O
requirement	O
on	O
or	O
submission	O
of	O

and	O

with	O
the	O
requirement	O
on	O
or	O
submission	O
of	O

2)	O
As	O
to	O
verification,	O
non-compliance	O
therewith	O
or	O
a	O
defect	O
therein	O
does	O
not	O
necessarily	O
render	O
the	O
pleading	O
fatally	O
defective.	O
The	O
court	O
may	O
order	O
its	O
submission	O
or	O
correction	O
or	O
act	O
on	O
the	O
pleading	O
if	O
the	O
attending	O
circumstances	O
are	O
such	O
that	O
strict	O
compliance	O
with	O
the	O
Rule	O
may	O
be	O
dispensed	O
with	O
in	O
order	O
that	O
the	O
ends	O
of	O
justice	O
may	O
be	O
served	O
thereby.	O
3)	O
Verification	O
is	O
deemed	O
substantially	O
complied	O
with	O
when	O
one	O
who	O
has	O
ample	O

to	O

of	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

the	O

have	O
been	O

in	O

or	O
are	O

4)	O
As	O
to	O

against	O
forum	O
shopping,	O
non-compliance	O
therewith	O
or	O
a	O
defect	O
therein,	O
unlike	O
in	O

is	O
generally	O
not	O
curable	O
by	O
its	O
subsequent	O

or	O

thereof,	O
unless	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
need	O
to	O
relax	O
the	O
Rule	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
of	O
"substantial	O
compliance"	O
or	O
presence	O
of	O
"special	O

or	O
compelling	O
reasons."	O
5)	O
The	O
certification	O
against	O
forum	O
shopping	O
must	O
be	O
signed	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
plaintiffs	O
or	O
petitioners	O
in	O
a	O
case;	O
otherwise,	O
those	O
who	O
did	O
not	O
sign	O
will	O
be	O
dropped	O
as	O
parties	O
to	O
the	O
case.	O
Under	O
reasonable	O
or	O
justifiable	O
circumstances,	O
however,	O
as	O
when	O
all	O
the	O
plaintiffs	O
or	O
petitioners	O
share	O
a	O
common	O
interest	O
and	O
invoke	O
a	O
common	O

of	O

or	O

the	O
signature	O
of	O
only	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
certification	O

substantially	O
complies	O
with	O
the	O
Rule.	O
6)	O
Finally,	O
the	O
certification	O
against	O
forum	O
shopping	O
must	O
be	O
executed	O
by	O
the	O
party-pleader,	O
not	O
by	O
his	O
counsel.	O
If,	O
however,	O
for	O
reasonable	O
or	O
justifiable	O
reasons,	O
the	O
party-pleader	O
is	O
unable	O
to	O
sign,	O
he	O
must	O
execute	O
a	O
Special	O
Power	O
of	O
Attorney	O
designating	O
his	O
counsel	O
of	O
record	O
to	O
sign	O
on	O
his	O
behalf.	O
(Emphases	O
Ours)	O
Applying	O
the	O
above	O
guidelines	O
to	O
the	O
present	O
case,	O
We	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
subject	O
Verification/Certification	O
of	O
Non-forum	O
Shopping	O
substantially	O
complied	O
with	O
the	O
rules.	O
Petitioners	O
share	O
a	O
common	O
interest	O
and	O
have	O
similar	O
claims	O
in	O
the	O
subject	O
property	O
and	O
that	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
can	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
"one	O
who	O
has	O
ample	O
knowledge	O
to	O
swear	O
to	O
the	O
truth	O
of	O
the	O
allegations"	O
to	O
sign	O
the	O
required	O
verification.	O
Moreover,	O
their	O
assertion	O
of	O
a	O
common	O
cause	O
of	O
action	O
or	O
defense	O
empowers	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
sign	O
the	O
certification	O
against	O
forum	O
shopping	O
to	O
substantially	O
comply	O
with	O
the	O
rule.	O
After	O
all,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
held	O
that	O
under	O
reasonable	O
or	O
justifiable	O
circumstances,	O
as	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
where	O
the	O
petitioners	O
share	O
a	O
common	O
interest	O
and	O
invoke	O
a	O
common	O
cause	O
of	O
action	O
or	O
defense,	O
the	O
rule	O
requiring	O
all	O
such	O
plaintiffs	O
or	O
petitioners	O
to	O
sign	O
the	O
certification	O
against	O
forum	O
shopping	O
may	O
be	O
relaxed.	O
It	O
should	O
be	O
noted	O
that	O
the	O
rules	O
on	O
verification	O
and	O
certification	O
against	O
forum	O
shopping	O
are	O
designed	O
to	O
promote	O
and	O
facilitate	O
the	O
orderly	O
administration	O
of	O
justice.	O
Hence,	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
interpreted	O
with	O
such	O
absolute	O
literalness	O
as	O
to	O
subvert	O
their	O
own	O
ultimate	O
and	O
legitimate	O
objectives.	O
The	O
requirement	O
of	O
strict	O
compliance	O
merely	O
underscores	O
their	O
mandatory	O
nature	O
to	O
the	O
effect	O
that	O
the	O
verification	O
and	O
certification	O
against	O
forum	O
shopping	O
cannot	O
altogether	O
be	O
dispensed	O
with	O
or	O
their	O
requirements	O
completely	O
disregarded.	O
They	O
do	O
not	O
prohibit	O
substantial	O
compliance	O
with	O
the	O
rules	O
under	O
justifiable	O
circumstances.	O
Therefore,	O
this	O
Court	O
cannot	O
dismiss	O
petitioners'	O
appeal	O
at	O
its	O
inception	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
formal	O
defects	O
in	O
the	O
verification/certification	O
of	O
non-forum	O
shopping.	O
Discretionary	O
power	O
to	O
review;	O
appeal	O
not	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
right	O
but	O
must	O
comply	O
with	O
requirements	O
for	O
its	O
perfection.	O
Respondents	O

to	O
another	O
defect	O
in	O
the	O
Petition	O

.	O
It	O
involves	O

act	O
of	O

We	O
emphasize	O
at	O
the	O

that	O
a	O

is	O
a	O

that	O
the	O

in	O
a	O

they	O

the	O

(1)	O
the	O
trial	O

in	O

the	O

the	O

would	O
entail	O
a	O

the	O
factual	O
circumstances	O
already	O
determined	O

similarly	O
concluded	O
by	O
the	O

are	O
essentially	O
questioning	O
the	O

of	O

asking	O
this	O
